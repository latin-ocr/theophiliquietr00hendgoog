upon the arts and the scienees. Gerbert, asterwards
Pope Silvester II.‚ was educated in the schools of the
Arabs, in Spain, in the tenth century, and acquired
their language. Lesa inventive than praetieal in seleuce,
the Arab writers appear to have aocnmulated the ex·
periente ol preceding authors rather than made new
discoveries, ιο have instructed rather than progressed.
The simple character of the early sciences of the far
east, with the speculative philosophy of the west.
appear to have been united to afford thern their know-
ledge. The Caliphs Hariin·al·Rashid and Al·Marni1n
were philosophers and seientifio men; they caused the
Greek classica to be translated into Arabic; from them
the writings of the Arab physicians are principally
drawn. The mystie doctrine of the neo-Platonio school
of Alexandria, eminently qualified ιο captivate the
ardent imagination of the Araba, was adopted by them;
they attributed to the science of alchemy the art
of transmuting the metals into gold and the universal
panacea ¹. Geber, their most famous chemist, who
appears to have lived in the eighth century, as he is

quoted by the Arab writers of the ninth, restored ,

alohemical solenne to its true nature, and thereby
earned the title of the father of chemistry. Geber has
the credit of making known the process oi distillation
by a simple description, although this art had been for
centurias described in tlre books of the initiated⁸.
