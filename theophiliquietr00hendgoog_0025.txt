The ninth century, however, offers the important fact,
in the history of the arte, of the invention or introduction
ofPaintinguponGlass. TheBenediotineshaveremarked
upon this fact, and attribute the period, with every proba-
bility,tothe reign of Charlemugne, who died in814¹. The
art itselfis probably cf Byzantine origin, as the flux for
colouring a plate or vessel of glasa was known to the
Greeks, who were much employed in the manufacture ol
the coloured and gilt glass mosaic work, ns we shall pre-
sently see. Α. fact is mentioned in the chronicles oi
the historian of the monastery oi St. Benignus, at Dijon‚ ’
who wrote about the year 1052 ². He states “that
there existed pot ic lvio time a very ancient gloss window,
in the church of the monastery, representing the mar·
tyrdom of St. Paschasie‚ ond that this pointing had

been taken from the old church restored by Charles
the ΒοΙεί.”8 The reasoning appears inconclusive by

which David seeks to limit the invention to the reign
of this later monarch, aa such poete, who have at all
alluded to coloured gloss aa used in windows have so
cursorily noticed it, that it is sometimes even difficult
to determine their meaning3 the art was neither neces·
canly, nor would it be even probably, included in their
descriptione, which relate to the effect produced by the
light transmitted through the coloured medium ⁴.
