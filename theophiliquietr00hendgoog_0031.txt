very early and incompleta knowledge of their works,

which he had probably heard of in Constantinoplc or
l

Itahllohsieur Guichard, Monsieur Didron, and the Abbe

Texis‘rr assuredly have assigned too late a period, when
they fix the twelfth or thirteenth century as the epoch
of Theophilus.

It is remarkable, and isacorrelativc proof with what

has been remarked above, that there is no mention in
the ‘⁴ Treatise upon Divers Arta ” of distillation, noris
any substance indicated by which we can presumc that
Theophilus was acquainted with that art. This, coupled
with the preceding facts, will place our author in a pe·
riod of transition or among the writers of the early part
of the eleventh century. Tho school of medicine ol
Salerno had hut commeneed at that period to inculcata
the Arab science, and to disseminate it through Italy.
Had Theophilus been cotemporary with Roger Bacon
or Raymond Lully‚ as Mr. Guichard supposes, this art,
which would have simplified so many ofhis processes and
which has added so many materiale to art, would have
been noticed. The influence of the crusades, although
doubtless great upon the taste of Westem Europe, we
have already seen could have but little, if at all, added
to the sciences. There is no art mentioned by Theo-
philus which was unknown at the commencement of
the eleventh century; yet distillation‚ or any of its pro-
ducts, is omitted, although a glimmering of Arab science
is observahle in the work.

known in France and the other countries of Europe.” Hoefer‚
