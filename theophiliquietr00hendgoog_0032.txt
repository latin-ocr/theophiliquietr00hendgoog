xviii rennues.

Another circumstance may be adduced favourable to
this opinion. The very few instences in which Theo·
philus affords iconographical description are eminently
of this period of art. Iu the delineation of the beaten
censer, L. HLO. 60, Byzantine art is particularly ob-
servable; the octanguler tovers, the long colurnus, the
lengthened windows, the circulor opening above the
centre column between them¹3 the rivers of Paradiae
in human form, the raised arch at the bottom of the
censer, in which are the ligures of the evangeliste,
whether deliuested in likeness of men or symbolicelly,
are all of Byzantius nrt; but in C. 61, the marks of the
period ore yet stronger. The figures of the J ewish
prophete frateruiued with those of the opostles, with
their names inscribed above the head, each provided
with their testimonies “that they may agree with each
other;’'² the personificetion of the virtues, also with
the name inscribed3 the Arabesques3 are not only By-
zantine, but, if introduced into the West, indicate, ac·
cording to M. Didron, sn early period of the eleventh
century. “The East‚ where the old law was born, el-
ways remained faithful to its respect for the J ewisb
lew, and the personages of the Old Testament With
us, the characters of the Old Testament, however ele-
vated in esteem and glory, are not equivalent to assint,

decoration ol' the thirteenth century, which M. Guichard and the
Abte Texler attribute to it.

² “The Greeks, more discourrive than tha nativos os the Wert,
place inscriptions every where. This ise great advantage. Had ,
our Gothic enceatorr acted thus, we, erchaeologists‚ should have
lesa trouble tc openly, or name, personage· and subjecto sculptured

or painted in our churches.'' Didron, Manccl de l'Ioonog. carte.
