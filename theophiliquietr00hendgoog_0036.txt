Another MS. of tho serenteeuth century was an·
uounced by Morelli in the Noni Library at Venice, in
which Theophilus is called Ruauuus. Morelli states
that this ia copied from the ancient parchment Codex
in the Imperial Library at Vienna: “descripti aa· antiquo
codice membranaceo muurucripto Aupuattrat'mce Biblio-

tlecce Coesareae V r'rrdoborrcrrorlrfi M. Guichsrd has omit-
ted this conclusion to his quotation from Morelli, and
questions the correctness of the statement made in p.
35 (Metelli, Cod. manuscript. Lat. Bidlr'otlr. Noni.) that
there were two manuscripts of Theophilus at Vienna.

Mrs. Merrifield¹ writes to me that she saw a copy of
Theophilus at Milan, made from the old Vienna Mann-
script, similar to that in the library of St. Mark at
Venice.

The copy contained¹ by the Le Begue MS. in the
Royul Library at Paris has already been notioed. It
is a very careless transcription of the first twenty-nine
chapters of the First Book only, and in quantity is si-
milar to the Trinity College MS. published by Respo,
but the appendix is wanting.

Although neither Lambecius nor otherbibliographers
have noticed the Manusoripts at Vienna, and, in conse-
quence, M. Guichard suspects some error in the state·
ment of Morelli already referred to, Ι have been able
to ascertain, through the kindness of Dr. Ferdinand
Wolf, ot the Imperial Library, that the assertion of

Morelli is correct. ,'
