senesce. xxiii

No. 2527), belongs to the twelfth, or, at latest, to the
very commencement‘ of the thirteenth century; the
other (No. 11236) is but a copy, but made from an·
other manuscript than our own3 it is of the seventeenth
century, and is upon paper.”

‘⁶ The ancient manuscript is defective: it commences
by the three prolognes of the three books, the index of
chapters of the first book follows The rubrio of the
first chapter stands, De temperamento cadorum io mccc
corporibus the last, the thirty-eighth, Quomodo colores
io too tempermtur. The second book contains thirty·
five chapters oi which the title of the first is, Do coo·
structiooesmni ad operandum citrum the 1181111111-
lis. The third book contains seventyeight chapters;
the first, Dc cmwtmcctioncsobricoe, the last, Dc orcanae
but, asI have said, some leaves arc wanting at the end.’'

“The other MS„ the modein copy, gives also the
prologue of ecch book, and then the index; the first
book contains forty-two chapters, vin, De temperamento
colinam dyc, the last, Dc corona. The second hook is
composed of thirty-five chapters‚ conformable in every
thing to the other MS.; and the third book contains
seventy-six chapters, vin, Dc commotione fcbricoe;
the last, De organis, and finishes ‘a plectro comm inse
rico omnes onius mensuro ct mdccc grossitudine mant.
Finis! ”

It will be seen that the more modern manuscript is
similar to that ot Wolfenbiittel, which is deficient in
the C. xl. L. 1. Dc caccuato, contained hythe Harleian
and the Cambridge University MSS.

Dr. Wolf thus replies 1ο my demand respecting the

four missing chapters in the second book, which yet
form a part of the index.
