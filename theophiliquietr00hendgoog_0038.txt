“Vienna 5th Sept. 1846.
“The chapters which ere wanting in your¹ manu·

script, and of which yon have requested a copy, are
equally absent from both our manuscripts, although
they ligure in the index3 in this respect, therefore, our
MSS. arc exactly conformable to the printed text.’'-
(le Edition os Leiste ond Lessing.)

“I have the pleasure of remitting you the facsimile
of the first page of our most ancient manuscript, (of
the twelfth century) which you likewise requested,
and which, at my request‚ my colleague, M. Ernest
Birk, proficient in this art, has had the kindness to
transcribe?

This fac-simile I have caused to be placed at the
commencement of the work, as it belongs apparently to
the most ancient copy of Theophilus known, one of the
twelfth century, and it bears the name of Ruounus.

For how can we reconcile the conflicting opinions of
Lessing and Leiste? Lessing affirma the Wolfenbiittel
MS. to be of the eleventh, Leiste, of the tenth oen-
tury; both Lessing and Leiste assign the thirteeuth or
fourteenth century as the dete of the Leipsic manu-
script ; Leiste himself was undecided, aa the following
passage will prove. comparing the manuscripts of
Wolfenbiittel and Leipsic, he writes, “Beryde sind in
proso Quart oris Peryomea yeaclrriebea, aad ‚ykiclea aiod
salar ia dea Schrzflzttyea, so dosa moa aie wuhrsclreialich
ia ein Jahrtaadert ocraetzea rauca?¹

Paleographical knowledge has much increased since

“ Both are written in large quarto on parchment, and resemble
each other much in the written character,; it appears, therefore,
that they must be placed in one and the same century.”
