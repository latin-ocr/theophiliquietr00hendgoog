The most important, because the most voluminous
and correct, if not the most ancient, manuscript, now
remains to be noticed, and which 1 was fortunate
enough to discover among the Harleian Manuscripts at
the British Museum. Owing to the imperfect classifi·
cation of these MSS. towards the end of the last cen·
tury, this had remained unknown or unnoticed until I
had withdrawn it from its hiding-plaee; classed in the
general catalogue immediately under the head of Tna-
onoex, and after “ Theophilus ’' the ecclesiastic, is found
‘⁶ Theophilus, monachus;” it has doubtless therefore,
been classed with works on theology. It is not men·
tioned under the works treating upon the arta, but
under the head “Natural Philosophy,’' “Physics,” is
found “Theophilus Monachus, de Chemia,” a position
in which we should never have expected to find our
author upon ‘⁶ The Divers Arts,” and which sufficiently
accounts forits neglect¹.

This manuscript is upon vellum, in octavo, and is

of the existence of such a manuscript, he was unacquainted with
ita true importante and velue, until ir had been called for by me in
lanuary, 1844, and he had collated it with the Paris edition,
printed in 1848, by the Count Charles de l’Eacalopier.
