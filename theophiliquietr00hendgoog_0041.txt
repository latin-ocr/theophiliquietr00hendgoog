aud whose authority is conclusive, states that it is oi
that period, and that it is certainly written in Germany ¹.
It contains 115 folios of the books of Theophilus, and
five folios ol recipes relating to the arto, written by
another hand of the period. A treatise ‘⁶ Dc Unguen-
tis '’ follows3 it is a collection of medical recipes. Tha
title and prefaee to the first hook are unfortunately
wanting3 in so voluminous and superior acopy sorne-
thing might have been otherwise adduced from these
which would have unravelled the mystery which shrouds
the age and country of our author.

That this MS. is likewise but a copy from an older
work is proved by tho variatione it presente from the
Vienna and Wolfenbiittel MSS„ supplying many omis-
sione, claiming also tha restoration of a few whichI
have carefully noted during the progreas of the work.
The four chapters missing in the second book (see
Index, p. 110), have probably been cut from the ori-
ginal, as no lacuna is left by the scribe in this.

It will be observed upon perusal that the whole of
tho work, from C. LXXXI. L. ΙΙΙ. p. 345, is new.
It had been hitherto lost3 tho promises held out in the
preface to the First Book are fulfilled.

The Third Book has evidently been treated by
Theophilus with more care and attachment than the
others. The eloquent preface, the labour expended in
description, and the great volume of tho work upon
metals, attest this. He had proceeded gradually to
describe ‘⁴ all those things which were still wanting
among the utensils of the House of the Lord,”¹ when

¹ Sir Frederick stated tome that it was not impossible that this
MS. was written at the end os the tvvelllh century.
