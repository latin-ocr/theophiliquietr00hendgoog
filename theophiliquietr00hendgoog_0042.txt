the treatise abruptly closed with ‚one chapter on the
construction of the orgen. The description of this
instrument is now rendered complete¹ as it existed in
the time of our author. An important descriptiones
the ¹manner of founding bells follows. The next, “Of
Musical Cymbals,” tends to show the antiquity of the
author. Our monk treats of the more humble vessels,
made of tin; of irou, with a description of the apparatus
employed in Damascus work upon steel. Then follows
adescriptiou of the Italian work promised in the pre- .
face to the whole work, of sculpturing, gilding aud
staining ivory; of gems, pearls aud electra. It should

. be remarkod here that Theophilus quotes Eraclius,a

strong argument against his Italian origin. The monk
would here appear to have travelled, note-hook in hand,
to collect the various arts from different countries.
The passage in the preface to the Second Book, which
I have preferred to translate literally, rather than to
take in the allegorical sense, in which it has been
hitherto received, and which the character and writiugs
of Theophilus do not warrant, affords strong presump-
tion that Theophilus was no Greek monk, which his
description of the “fistula” the reed or pipe formerly
used hythe Roman Church in the celebratior of the
