Having shown, in a note to L. I. p. 63, ot what the
vernish of Theophilus was composed, and which was
employed during the early period of art, there is every
reason to believe that “ Annua Vnmvtsn” was oue of
the inventione of the brothers Van Eyck3 and that this
invention was carried into the school of Venice we have
proof ¹. The head of a Venetian Doge, by John Bellini,
in the National Gallery, is painted with this vamish.
Mr. Eastlake pointed out to me the umber beads
hanging upon the wellin the picture by Van Eyek,
in the same place: this is a curious circumstance worth
notice.

In the manuscript, Sloaue 345, Pl. 85 C, which
contains a series of medical writiugs, ‘⁸ Traet. Ver. Me-
dicinal.” collected by J ohannes Ketham, who flourished
towards the latter part of the fiftecuth century, is a
book upon colours and materiale for pointing, written in
old Dutch or Flemish, and which should therefore be of
an earlier period in the same century. In this I found
the first mention of amber vamish yet upon record, and
it arrives from the country of Van Eyck. The MS. is
- extremely difficult to read.
