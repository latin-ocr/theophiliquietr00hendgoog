In the accounts handed down to us, Van Eyck is do·
scribed as a olever chemist‚ and it is stated that he was
continually consulting works upon that science for in·
formation. The works of the Arab chemists had be-
come known: Albertus Magnus, Roger Bucon, Arnold
of Villa Nova, Raymond Lully, had all lived and written
upon the “Magnum Opus‚'’ the basis of which rested
upon sublimation and distillatiom by means of which
the elixir, spirit, or excellence of all things were to be
extracted. The words of tommo, which we have
quoted above, would therefore probably bear a literal
meaning.

Leouardo da Vinci is stated to have followed the
manner of oolouring invented by John of Bruges, and
to have thinned his oil by means of alembics. This, 1
was convinced, hrtended that Leonardo distilled the oil
(he himself mentions walnut oil) for the purpose 'of
pointing.

various modes of making this varnish practised in ltaly at a later
period. The process here described would make s very darlt
varnish, which would require to be thinned with welnut or other
oil for use.
