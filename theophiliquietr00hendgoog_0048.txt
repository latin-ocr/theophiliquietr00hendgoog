having always found that by stillare or assotiyliore par
hambiaca distillation was intended, while liltration was de-
scribed as distillare perfidio, it became necessary to seek
for any precedent that distilled liuseed, or walnut oit,
was used in the art of paintiug, experimenting‚ at the
sometime, at home. Ivvas fortunate enough to sue·
eeed in both instauoes ¹.

¹ I think it better to give the result of the experiment as l noted
it down at the time it was tried, without further comment than that
it isone which should be attempted by no inexperienced hands3
the explosive nature of the gas produced rendering the process
highly dangerous to an unskilsul person, although every simple
and easy one to the chemist‚ or other operator.

. 4 oz. distilled in aglaes retort and receiver, over a small ehar-
coal lire without fleme.

Water was the first product3 then came over alight·coloured
empyreumatic oil, which gradually became ol a darker colour,

mixed with water during the whole process of distillation.

The ebullition in the retort was at first great, but it gradually
lessened aethe oil became of greater substance. Theheatis required
to be increased to keep up the vapour producing the distilled oil.
As the process continued, this vapour became more abundant, and
a quantity of gas was liberated, to allow of the escape of which the
stopper in the receiver must be greased and loosely dropped into
its place; care should be taken to visit this olteu, in order to guard
against explosion. lt appears to me during this process that oil
will not spontaneously take fire at a great heat3 it requires contact
with fleme or a red beat in order to do so.

Carbonis aoid aad carburetted hydrogerr gos are the principal
gases produced. This mixture of gasea, probably owing to the
great excess ol carburetted hydrogen‚ is highly inflammablc: it is
the productiori of this, not of a highly inflammable volatile oil,
which causes ott, raised to every high temperatura, to take lire
when in conmet with fleme, or highly heated bodies, such as red-
hot iron, ¹dre,

Volatile oils of two specilic gravities were produced3 the first
