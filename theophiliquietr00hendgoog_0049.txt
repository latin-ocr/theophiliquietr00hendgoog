Panna. XXXV

The earliest mention Ι find of distilled linseed oll is
in conjunction with amber varnish; it isto be used as
ararnish, or glane, upon pointed subjecta, aud lt is oon-
tained in a collection of recipes relative to the Arta,

less specific gravity. and also of a lighter colour than that which Ἴ

follows, and it forms a stratum upon the darher and denser vola-
tile oil. The davker volatile oil is of the colour of pale timber,
the lighter a very pale straw colour, almost colourless. They
unite by agitation‚ as also will the small quantity of water, it the oil
is not caresully decanted from it.

Marcomannis, October 28, 1845.

This distilled or empyreumatic oil should be kept in ajat covered
with muslin so as merely to keep out dust and dirt, but to allow tlte
entrance of air 8ηά the escape ol the empyreuma. ln a short time
this oil, which is at first so pungent and offensive, becomes gradu·
nlly of less powerlul odour, 8ηά in a few weeks is not of'more un·
pleasant smell than boiled linseed oil. It appears to absorb oxy-
gen by contest with air, and at a temperatura ol 40⁹, F. becomes
flocculent in appearance, while at 70⁰, F. it remains transparent.
This is not 8 deposition of stearine, but the effect of a diminution
ol' temperatura the absence of hest causing it to become solid, as is
the case with many distilled oils‚ at that temperatura.

Amber varnish‚ (8ηά probably other thick oil varnlshea) would
be equally benefited thinned with this distilled oil; it dries witb-
out a pellicle when mixed with colours. Oolours used for finish-
iuga picture, such as in the light for solid pointing, or glazing sor
colour and shsdowa are rendered very pure, and without the
slightest appearance of a alain, although it may be plentilully used.
It dries much more slowly than any other distilled oil‚ and hence
its great salue, as it allows the artist samuch time as he requires
in order to blend his colours and finish his work. ln conjunctiora
with umber varniah it forms a vehicla which leaves nothing to be
desired, and tvhich doubtless was the vehicle os Van Eyclr‚ and
in many instance· of the Venetiae masters, 8ηά of Correggio‚ the
different modes os pointing necessarily producing tha varied appear·
antes of the different schools and masters. ·
