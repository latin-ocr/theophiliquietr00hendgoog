But “ de pictura satis superque,” and my labours are
drawing to a close. In my notes I heve offered such
¹ explanations of the terms used by Theophilus as the

limita afforded me will allow: I hope that the reader will
not find them misplaced.

An increasing taste is obtaining for the beautiful and
spirited works of art belonging to the middle ages, for
things which the lest century abandoned to contempt
and neglect: the important works which have lately
been undertaken in this country, and which are pro-
bably destined to increase, render an apology for the in·
traduction of this book needless; information upon
these subjecte is every where songht, and an opportu-
nity is affordedj for the instruction of the artist and
arthemas much needed in our time asin that of our
author. The prospect of the general diffusion and em· ,

Sayd, one of the conditione ol the peace, concluded at the, corn-
mencenrent of the eighrh century between the Csliph Valid and
the Greek Emperor, was, that the latter should lurnish a certain
quantity of ‘⁶ isefysa '’ for the decoration of the Mosqne of Damas·
cus, which the caliph was then constructing. (Notice upon tlre Worlcs
os M. deProngey, Journal Asiatiqne, An. 1842, p. 9, 10.) The same
word, “ ilibas,” is found in the Athos MS. (loc. cit.) to designate
mosaica. “ But‚” writes M. Didron, “these are mosaice in gloss,
transparent, with golden grounds, as the words ’ψήφοις morior&
indicate: these are the mosaica which cover the vaults, cupolas,
and a pert of the walls oi St. Sophia of Constantinople‚ oi St.
Sophia ol salonica, of Vatopedi and of St. Laura os Mount Athos,
of Daphne near Athens, of St. Luke in Livadia, of the round
temples of Salonica and of Ravenna. Moesicis Byzantina and
Christian, and the Arabs, who have merelya horrowed architec-
ture, bave even horrowed a great portion of their embellishment.”
The ,word “mosaic” was most probably derived from the word
“mosque‘’ for the edornment ol which the Byzantine Greeks were
much employed in producing these cubic glsas atonea.
