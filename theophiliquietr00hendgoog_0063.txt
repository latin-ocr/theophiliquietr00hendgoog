thet in me they may recognise the goodness and ed-
mire the generosity of God, and I advise them likewise
that if to this their labours are added, they may believe
beyond a doubt that excellence aweits them.

Andes it is iniquitous sud detesteble to a men to
appropriate through covetousness, in any manner, that
which is unlawful, or undue, or to scine it with theft, ιο
also to neglect untried, or contemptuously to turn from
an heritage given ns a right by God the Father, is to
be ascribed to cowardice, and folly. Whoever thou
art, therefore, dearest son, in whose heart God has
placed the desire to exploro the vast field of the divers
arte, and to bring thereto intellect and cere, that thou
mayest afterwards collect therefrom that which may
plecse thee, think not thou cheeply of any precious end
useful things3 as if the domestic soil produced them
for thee spontaneously, or unsought for; he would be a
foolish calculator who suddenly finding e treasure in a
bole in the ground, should neglect to gether and keep it.
But if for thee the common shrubs produced myrrh,
thus end belsam, or the domestic springs poured forth
oil, milk and honey‚ or, for the nettle and thistle end
other weeds of the garden, grew spikensrd and cin-
namon and¹ aromatico of various kinds, wouldst thou,
these being despised as common and domestic, trevel
over lands and sees efter foreign things not better, but
perhaps morevile in comparisonf this, in thino own
judgment, would bes great folly. For however men
are cccustomed to place in the first rank snd to keep
with the greatest care some precious things sought

with much labour ond acquired with great expense,
yet, if by chance they are sometimes'met with cheaply, .
or like, or better things, ore found, they are preserved
with a similar, yes, vvitb a greater care.
