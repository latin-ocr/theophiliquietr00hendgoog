its poso and rose colour and light are made as before. When
figures, or likeness of other things, are portrayed on a dry
wall, it is lirst sprinkled with water until at length it is com-
pletely soaked. Audin this humidity all colours, which are
superposed‚ are painted, all which are mixed with lime, and
let them dry with the wall itsell, that they may adhere. A

called veneda, mixed from black and lime, upon which, when
dry, lazur is laid in its place thinly, tempered with yoke ol
egg abundantly tempered with water, and over this again,
more thiclrly because of its beauty. Green also is mixed with
succus and black.
