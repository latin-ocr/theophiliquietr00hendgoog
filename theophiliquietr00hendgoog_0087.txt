GLUE OF CHEESE.

Tun tablets of alters, or of doors, are first cerefully fitted
together with the joining instrument which carpentem or vat
melers use3 they are then joined with the glue ol cbeese,
which is made in this manner. Sost cheese is cut very small,
and ie wushed with warm water in a smell mortar with a
peetle, until, being frequently poured in, the water comes
away pure. Then this cheese, compressed by the hand, ie
put into cold water until it herdens. Alter this it is very
finely ground, with another piece ol wood, upon n smooth
wooden table, and in this state it is egnin placed in the
mortar, end is carelhlly ground with the peetle, water mixed
with quick lime being added, until itis mede as thick es lees.
The tablets of alters fastened together with this glue, efter

¹ they ere dry, so adhere together, thet neither hcet nor hu-

midity ere sble to disjoin them. They should elterwerds be
smoothed with a plening iron, which, curved und shnrp in-
side, has two bundles, so thet it moy be drawn by both
hands, (with which doors and shields ere shewed) until they
are made perfectly smooth. They ure then covered with the
unmnned skin ol a horse, or ass, which is soeked in water3
as soon as the heirs have been scraped off, some water is
squeezed from it, und thus moist, it is superposed with the
uurd glue.
