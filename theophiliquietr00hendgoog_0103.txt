01² (sarnunto GOLD ROB BOOKS AND OF CASTING THE ulhn.

Wusu you have traced out figures or letters in books, take
pure gold and lile it very finely in a clean cup or small basin,
aud wash it with a peucil iu the shell of a tortoise, or a shell
which is taken out of the water. Have then a mill with its
pestle, both cast from metal of copper and tin mixed toge-
ther, so that three parts may be of pure copper, and the fourth
os pure tin, free from lead. With this composition the mill is
cast in the form of asmall mortar, and its pestle round about
an iron in the form of a knot, so that the iron may protrude
of the thickness of a finger, and in length a little more than

half a scot, the third part of which ironis fixed in wood care· ,

which the pestle of the mill will revolve. These things thus
disposed, the gold, carefully cleansed, is put into the mill, a
little water added, and the pestle placed, and the upper piece
of wood fitted, the strap is drawn and is permitted to revolve,
again pulled and again it revolves, and this must so be done
for two or three hours. Thea the upper wood is taken off,
and the pestle wasbed in the same water with apencil. Alter-

stirrcd to the bottorn with the pencil, and is lert a little, until
the grosser part subsides 3 the water is presently poured into
