wood above being placed, again it is milled in the same way as
before, until it altogether comes away with the water. ln the
like manner are ground silver, brass, and copper. But gold
isground most carefully, and must be lightlymilled3 and you
must osten inspect it, because it is sotter than the other metals‚
that it may not adhere to the mill or the pestle, and become t
heaped together. lt through negligence this should happen,
· that which is conglomerate is scraped together 3ηά taken out,
and what is lestis milled until finished. Which being done,
pouring out the upper water with the impurities from the
basin, wash the gold carehrlly ina clean ehell. Then pour-
ing the water from it, agitate it with the pencil, and when you
have had'it in your hand lor one hour, pour it into another
shell, and keep that very fine part which has come away with
the water. Then again, water being placed with it, warrn it,
and stir it over the tire, aud, as before, pour away the fine par-
ticles with the water, and you may act thus until you shall
have purified it entirely. Alter this wash with water the same
refined part, and in the same manner, a second and a third
time, and whatever gold you gather mix with the former. In
the same way you will wash adver, brass, and copper. Aller-
wards take the bladder of a fish which is called huso, and
washing it three times in tepid water, cut it into very small
pisces, and putting it into a very clean pot with water, leave
it to sosten a night, and on the morrow warm it on the fire,
so that it does not boil up until you prove with your fingere
if it adhere, and when it shall adhere strongly, the glue is
good.
