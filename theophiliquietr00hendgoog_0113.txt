01³ sm GREEN.

11, however, you wish to make egreen colour, take oak wood,
as long and as large as you like, and hollow it in the form 01
0 box. 'l'hen take copper and 11110 11 1010 leaves, as broad as
you desire, so however that its length may cover the breadth
01 1110 hollow wood. Alter this take a plate 11111 01 salt, and ⁸
pressing it down strongly, cover it with 0110100οΙ 101 a night,
and on the morrow griud it carefully upon 0 dry stone. And
when you have taken some slender twigs, place 1110111 together
in the same hollowed wood, so 11101 two parts 01 the hollow
are below and the third above them, and thus coating the
copper plates on both sides with pure honey, sprinkling over
them the ground salt, you will fix them, joined together, upon
those twigs, eovering earefully with another wood fitted 101 this,
so that no 100001 can come out. Atterwards make 00 open-
ing, to be bored in au angle 01 1110 same wood, through which
you can pour warm vinegar, or 1101 01100, so as to fill a third
part 01 11, and then close the passage. Yon should put this
wood 10 such a place that you can wholly cover it with stable
dung. After four weeks raise the covering, and serape 011,
0011 keep whatever you find upon the copper, and again re·
placing it, cover it as above.

000001 thinned, and seraping them earefully on both 011100,
pour upon them pure and warin vinegar, without honey and
salt, and place them together in 0 smaller hollow 0100001
wood in the 011101 above. After two weeks examine and
