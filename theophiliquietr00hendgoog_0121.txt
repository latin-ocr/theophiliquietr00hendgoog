teodrils facilitate the formation of carbonic acid, and thus account
for the superiority of the Rhodian cernsel Marble is now used

The Byzantlne MS. published by Muratori¹‚ and which he
refers to the eighth century, gives the same receipt for making
¹⁶ white lead‚” “ De compositiou psimltthin.’'

Thus, no alteration in the manufactnre of white lead had been
attempted from the time of Aristotle to that of our author. 1.. l.

“Minium Album.” This MS. is of the early lralf of the four-
teenth century2.

The use of ceruse as apigment is confined by Theophilus to
plaster noth, stood, or canvass. Sir H. Davy in his analysis of the
colours of the ancients³ found that the whites he examined ‘⁸ were
all fine chellt‚'' yet, that Davy did not llnd white lead used upon a
murel decoration is no proof that it did not enter into the other
decoratione, or pictores, of the llomens, used in encaustic, or with
guma, gluten, or oil upon plaster work.

The white lead of the present period is a combination of prot·
oxlde of lead with carbonis acid, and is a sub-carbonate of lead.
lt is prepared, at Clichy, by forming a precipitate, with carbouic
aoid gas, in asaturated solution of prot-oxide of lead in distilled
rinegar. The current of carbonic aoid gas is passed through this
solution, and the precipitate is washed and dried.

A patent was recently taken in London for amsans of manu-
facturing white lead by one process from tlte metal. Very small
shot was violently agitated in water, by which a pulverulent
hydrated oxide nas produced. This, having been exposed to the
air, became converted into a carbonate.

Had this ponder been exposed to the action of carbonis aoid gas
in a close thember, a line carbonate of lead would have been pro·
duced fit for the artist; as itwse, the patent nas not much valued, aa
two processes would have been necessary during the manufactum.
