notive, the other factitious¹. The native, which was found in
Spain, was hard and stony, as was also that brought honr Colchis.
The factitious (which does not appear to be a cinnabar) caure from ¹
Ephesus in the sorrn osa saud, shining like scarlet, which was
ground and wsshed. Hill iubis notes to Theophrastus² thinks
that this latter substance was the “Sil Atticum ’¹ ol the Romans,
injudiciously conloundcd, he states, by Vitruvius with the Ochrs
Attica ol the ancients. Hill, however, produces no reason or
support sor this assertion. The “Sil Atticum‚'' was os s golden
colour, which was altered in its hue by burning. The origin os the
tcrrn is probably σέλας, fulgor, suro similis.

There were the ‘⁶ sit Atticum‚” Marmorosurn, and Pressurn, uel
Syricum.

The factitious cinnabar was more likely a true minium, the iu·
vention or introduction os Callias the Athenian. (See Minium.)

The “Natire Cinnabsr‚'' however, os Theophrastus was identical
with oure, it was vermilion, or sulphuret of quicksilver‚ and that
writer relates the process oi extracting the metal from the ore by
“ rubhing it with vinegsr with a brass pestle in a brass morter.”³
During this process the brsss would be attached hythe scid, and,
through the affinity of the copper for the sulphur, the cinnabar
would be reduced to the metallis state.

Dioscorides tells that ‘⁶ a cinnabaris worked in Spain⁴‚ and that
during the operation the workmen cover the sace with a skin
because of the (mercurial) vapours dangerous to inhale;” he like-
wise describes the process of extracting quicksilver srom cinnabar.

Pliny, lihewise, describesa ‘⁴ Cinnabar or Minium” “whose pro·
duce we hare called quicksilrer‚” “ cujus vomicam argentum vivum
appellavimus.”⁵

Cinnsbar wasthe “ Minium” of Vitruvius, who gives s process

sor using it in staining walls of a red colour⁶.

Cinnabar hss been confounded with tbe ‘⁸ Miltos” of the Greeks,
which is ared ochreous enrtb and the most ancient red colour
known. (See Sinopis; also Esekiel, c. 2³, v. 14.)
