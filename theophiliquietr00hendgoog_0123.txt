vermilion‚ ‘⁶ vermiculum optimum.'' “ 1f youwish to make the
best vermilion‚ tuine a gloss bottle and cover it with a lute outside;

and take one part oi quiclrsilvcr, by weight, and two, by weight, ‚

of white or yellow coloured sulphur. Put it into the above bottle,
which you afterwards place on four stoues, and, leying a very
slight fire oi coala round the bottle‚ cover its mouth with atile,
and when you see the smoke come white from the mouth oi the
botrie, close it, but uben ssmoke as red as the vermiliou shall
come out, take it from the lire aud you will have the best ver-
milion.” Similarrecipes are lound amongst the medical writers of
the thirteentb and sourteeuth century, but are movtly repetitione.
