Ex hac herba triagrana in ¹semine exeunt. Et exhiis grauia telae

lgive an extract frome Mu. belonging to the ‘⁴ Bibliothdque
Royale at Montpellicr‚” of the early part of the fifteenth century,

&a lt contains a notice upon the materiale and processea used
in tha arta, which appears to be drawn from the Byzantine source;
it ia entitled‚ “Liber diversorium artium.” 1 give the extract
upon folium. ‘⁶ De naturast distemperatione‘folii’ seu‘morellae.'”
“Quaedam herba eat interni Sancti OEgidii‚ ex hac herbd tria
grana in semine exeunt, sicque mirum colorem reddunt, qui color
folium dicunt, qui color sic distemperatur. Pannurn folii scindes
et fissura in coquilla pones, postea sic fundes claram ovi ct sine
maturescere, et fir purpureus. Diatempera folium mind, tempe-
rata curn aquia tepidd, rel curu lexiviri pernoctem unam; deinde
projicietur et distemperatur cum claro recenti3 adhibe modicum

daton et glutine casei preparato, distemperatur ς et sic permittatur
donec bene permixtum sit.'’

‘¹ Of the nature aod tempering of ⁴ folium,’ or ‘mulberry
colom-’¹‘ ‘⁸ lt is a certain plant in the country of St. Gilea‚ from
this plant in reed three grains proceed, and so yielda beautiful
colour, which rolour they call ⁶ folium,’ and which is thur tem-
pered. You cut up the eloth of folium, (dyed with folium) and
place the shreda in a small vessel, afterwards you pour the white
of egg over itand leave it to mature, and a purple is made. Temper
folium with urine, mixed with ivarm water, or with a lixivium,
during one night; it ia then poured out and tempered with fresh
gleire (of egg); puta little lime to it. A preparation of folium3
it is cut up into piecea, rery thiu and small, aud ia tempered with
prepared glue of checsc; and it ia thus lcft until it has well mixed

together.”
