Peter ol St. Audemar writes ol‘ lolium, “De folio quomodo
distemperatur? “ Purpureus color quem folium vocant laici, qui
lanam iude tingunt, vel potius Anglici, in quorum terra conficitur,
‘nuormam' vocant, oon uno semper modo distemperatur. Nam
aliqui cum urina, vel lexivia de cinere fraxinii facta, ut in parieti·
bus praecipue, alii in pergamenis cum visco de caseo, ita facto.’'
This identifies the solium os St. Audemar with our “madder,''
which was called ‘⁴ norma, nuorma or gorma,” in Celtic. This
allusion to our country at so early a period is not a little curious
in the history of the arta. The action of the acid or alkaliue sub·
stantes with which these vegetable purples or hluee were mixed
would of course influence their colour.

The “ morella,” was a species ol ‘⁸ solanum” hearing a darlr
berry or seed. The turnsol was used for making a violet colour,
the fruit of the mulberry tree, the elderherry, the petals of the
violet end many vegetable colours which must have been very little
permanent even in illuminated books.

varentia, waremie, Waranta or Garance, our Madder, was
lilrewise employed by the occiente.

Dioscorides uses the same term for madder which the Greeks
of the present day employ, iynlpolasor. The “ rubia tinctorum” ol
the Romans and the rubia major ol' the mediaeval chemista, in
order to distinguish it srorn the rubia minor, or buglmr, of the
allmnet, or anchusa species.

The ⁸⁶ Hysginum” of Vitruvius, which has been consounded hy
hie conrmentators1 with vaccinium (violet) and hyacinthum, (darlr
purple,) is the “alga tinctoris ” or “ lichen rocella” ol the modeme, «
the ‘oreeille’ of the French.’' Hyaginum from im, is without
doubt the wantos φῦκος of Theophrastus², who tells us that it grows
under the rocks in the leland ol' Crete, and that it is used to dye
eloth purple. Pliny³ tells us the same thing; tlte same author iden·
tifies the purple os hysginum with that ol Porsuolie “Quare
Puteolanum potius laudatur quam Tyrium, aut Gaetulicum, vel
Laconicum, unde pretiosissimae purpure: cauco est, quod hysgino
mxime inficitur rabiemque cogitur sorbere.‘' “But that srom
Pozauoli is more esteemed than the Tyrian, or Goetulian, or Laco·
nien, whence come the dearest purples: the cause is that a thing
