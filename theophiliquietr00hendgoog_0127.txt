is most powerl'ully dyed with hysginum and it is thought that the
red endures.’' ‘⁶ The painters (he continues) lay a ground with red
achre, then glazing over the purple with egg, they give the splen-
dour of minium.” Pliny here uses sandyx, for burnt ochre, and
minium l'or red lead. ‘⁸ l f they wish ratberto make a purple colour,
they underlay blue, then they overlay the pvrrpurissimum with egg.”

Xenophon, Cyr. viii. 3. 7, writes ὑηιυοβᾶφῆς, dyed purple.

Sir H. Davy states¹ that apale rose colour was found in a vase
in the Baths os Titus, that the colouring matter was vegetable,
and that it was mixed with a considerable quantity of carbonate of
lime, ¹(challr.) He proceeds, ‘⁶ lt differed from madder‚ as the
madder lalte gaves much deeper tint to muriatic acid and pro·
duced a tawny hue when its weak muriatic solution was acted on
by muriate ol' iron. The ancient lake did not change its colour.
The ancient lalte agreed with the lalte of cophineal in being ren·
dered of adeeper hue by wealr alkalies, and of abrighter hue by
wesk acida, hut it differed from it in being rnuch more easily de·
stroyed by strong acids. It agreed with both in being immediately
destroyed by a solution ol chlorine.”

Was this colour “meinai'’ (the colouring matter of the
“ lichen roccella” and the hysginum of the ancients.) Isso, this
valuable colour seen by Davy, and which astonished all who saw
it, should not be neglected.

In the Tab. Voc. Syn. we lind, ‘⁴ Purple, which isa red colour,
is otherwise called ‘ folium3’ and the English, in whose country it
is grown, call it ¹ wormam.¹ A purple colour is also made from the
stone, sil, burnt, and extinguished in vinegar while it is glowing.
Oster is a lish, of the sea or elsewhere, from which a purple colour
is made, or from its blood; and also the sea conchae, when cut,
malrea purple colour. And likewise white chalk tinctured with
madder‚ (rubea radici). So also the herb called vaccinium yields

to the consideration ol the lake of the ancients.

“ Lacca is alrind of gum made of the red liquor which proceeds
