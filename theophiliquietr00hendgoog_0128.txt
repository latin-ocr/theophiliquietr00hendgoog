the Gallie is called '‘yene,’ and ‘herre,' the branchos of which
being perforated or cut half through below, in the month oi March,
give out a red liquor which, boiled with urine, is ‘lake,' with
which the skins oi swine are stained:” and again,

‘⁴ Gurn lacha of the ivy is made lrom the juice or liquor
flowing in March from the boughs of the ivy plant, cleaving and
growing to the trees, ii cut with a sharp instrument.” This will
be noticed more lully in notes to lib. 3.

The lucca ol Cennini ia doubtless our ‘⁶ gum-lac,’' yet the gunt-
lacha of the Greeks was more properly so called, being a turegum
not a resinous substance.

Another vegetable purple red, which will corne under the head
‘⁸ Folium,” was made from the “ Bresilium Lignum.”

“ Braxiliurn vel Brexiliunr est lignum rubeum, a quo cunr pistus,
roseus sit, in lixivio sorti, vel urinis, curn albumine commiscetur,
exit color roseus vel purpurcue.’'-Tab. Voc. Syn.

Thu Braail or Bresil wood was in use at an early period l'or a
purple or rose coloured dyc we have abundant evidence. Moses
speaks of “ rams‘ skins dyed red,’'¹ 'ubit algom, ζύλοι aelstano, the
Brasile trce, according to Holyoke. This word hae been rendered
in a French version os the T estament, “ jaune'' as it frorn “ adom‘'
b ‘⁴ adarnah,” terra, and therefore judged to mean “ yellotv ochre.”

The word Brasilium is probably derived from the Greek Βςάζυ.

The Pseudo Santalurn, vulgo ‘⁸ Saunders wood,'’ from which the
red colonr was obtained, isa native of the East. Huet² states
that “Sampian wood, which is the carne os Brasil, comes from the
East lnrlies.” It doubtless found its way into Egypt by the Red
Sea, and thus became known to Moses, who could have taught us
much relating to the arts ol the Egyptians.

Thus, contrary to the received opinion, the country Brnail has
taken from rather than given the name, to the wood which it

yielded ol so fine quality and in such quantity.
Chaucer mentions Brasil wootl before the discovery of the Nevr

World.
