and the varnish of Theophilus, the writer is seen cumbating with

his error: he evades the text, supposes mistake in the given quan-
tity and imperfect description as to the mode of making the var·
nish, questioning the intentione of his author, in order to render
his own idea teneble.

The followers of Ruspe, who see the Latin “Glessum'’ and
“ Amber‚” in the word, ‘⁴ glassa,” are still more lisble to the same
physical objections ; it would be found impossible to dissolve any
portion of smber by strictly adhering to the directions given by
Theophilus in c. al, and it is indispensably required that apro-
posed resin strictly fullils this condition.

On reading our author, the description given of the resin em·
ployed is clear: “et adde gummi (Arabici, Cod. R.) quod vocatur
fornis, minutissime tritum, quod habet speciem lucidissimi thuris,
sed cum frangitur fulgorem clariorem reddit.’' lt is impossible
that Theophilus, “ presbyter et monachus,¹‘ and therefore neces·
easily familiarly acquainted with “ Thus‚'’ or “ Frankincense,” as
used for incense, could compare with it any resin but one which
closely resembled it in outward appearance; in such a case of
comparium, the clear and concise writing of Theophilus, upon all
the practical subjecte on which lre treats, absolves him from care·
lessness, and even did the question rest upon this comparative
evidence alone, copal or umber are entirely out of the ques·
tion, neither possessing points of appearance in common with
‘⁸ Thus.'’

It was therefore necessary in the first place, in order to deter-
mine the gum resin of Theophilus, to fix upon one which borea
strong externa] resemblance to ‘⁶ Thus.” The line specimens of
the Arabic sandarac, wlsichexactly resemble the choice ‘⁴ Thus,” via.
the T. masculinum, corticosum, and feminoeum of the ancients,
pointed out that resin, for it has the distinguishing mark, a bright
glassy fracture, which the Thus has not; or, as Theophilus writes,
“ sed, curn frangitur, fulgorem clariorem reddit''

But the term “furnis'’ which is given to the resin will still
more strongly designate Sandarach, if it can be shown that this
isvrre hasbeen applied to that gum resin.

In the second process given by Theophilus for making the
“Gluten Vernition,” he calls the satne gum fornic “massa''
“supra dictum gummi furnis, quod llomane glassa dicitur,”
(“ aliter Arabicunr,” an interpolation in the Cod. Royal, Paris.)

if it can also be shown that this term uas likewise used to de·
