probably also thence its name of “Hauc Romana,” sor Andrea
Alpagus, in his “Liber Arabicorum Nominum,” tells us that,
“Harrire, id est Junipems,” and Rulandns, “Lex. Alchim.''
that ‘⁶ Hara, i. e. luniperus.'¹ ¹

The following will show that the comparative term, “ glarea,'’
has been applied to sandarac, aa glessum or glass to amber, pro·
bably for the same reason, “a similitudine ritri.” ‘⁶ Glassa est
genus vernicis.‘’ Rulandus, Lex. Alchem. “Glassa est genus
vernicis.” Johnson, Lex. Med. “Glassa est genus rernicis
siccioris.’¹ castelli, Lex. Chym. “ Vernice est vernix gattosa.’'

Johnson, Lex. M. “Sandarax, id est vernix gummi.'' Serapio,
c. 57. ·

But the word “ fornia,” the firniss, vulgo furniss, of the Ger-
mans, is a direct name i'or the same resin, from the Latin vernix.

Parr. Dic. Med. gives the derivation of the Arab word sandarac,
saghad-naralr,gummy; and this author calls the cedrus gummi
‘⁸ vernix '¹ ‘quia verno tempore fluat,' because it flows in the spring
asason.

Ruland has shown that the word “ sennis ” has been Latinized as
well aa “ glas,'' “porro qnia resina illa juniperi sandarax, et ver-
nix dicitur apud Arabes, unus error alterum traxit. Quidam in-
docti mox factitiunt hoc, quod vocamus vernis (oder cernhel) quo
utuntur pictores, et alii artifices, quod fit ex oleo et gummi, ha-
buere pro vera sandaracha metallica, ut ai scriberes,ll sandaracae,”
illi intellexerunt, secundum ⁸ Arabes,' Egummi vel resinam juni·
peri, aut ‘feralem’ illum factitium,'' &o

The Paris MS. contains the addition of the word “ Arabicum
“glassa vocatur, aliter Arabicum.” This manuscriptis ol' the
fifteenth century, and this interpolation isa proof that the ‘⁴ Arabio
sandarac '' was understood aa the “sornir '' by the copyist.

Pliny² “De picis generibus et resinis’‘ mentions “Arabica
resina,'’ and in so doing gives a good description o? santlarac.
“Arabica resina alba est, acri odore, difficile coquenti.” The
aciduloos pungent smell yielded by this resin when melted is pe·
culiar to it, and it is one of the most difficolt of the resina to unite

ol the ‘¹ blaclr poplar '' “ succina gemma.” Ep. lib. 4, 32, another conhuion.
