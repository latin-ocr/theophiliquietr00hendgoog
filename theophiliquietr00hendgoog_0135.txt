pictore excellentissimo inter omnes pictores mundi,” gave this
composition to be used in the preparation of ‘⁴ ultramarine,” aud
speaks first of ‘⁴ vernice liquida,” with which resin and gum mastic
are ιο be united. This was iu 1410.

John Le Begue himself gives the preparation ofa “vernia
liquide pour paintres.” The process is the same as that in the
second recipe of Theophilus. But Le Begue directe, “Take
aromatic glossa which is dull outaide, aud when broken it is clear
and shining inside, like glass.” ‘⁴ Prenea glasse aromatique qui est
obscur par dehere, et par dedans, quand on le brise, il cst clere et
luisanta maniere de verre.‘' With this, oil of linseed or hempseed,
or walnuts is to be used, two parts to one of resin. He concludes,
“ Et l’etendea desus la peinture a vos doigts, car si vous le fassiea

. du pincel, il seroit trop epais et ne pourroit secher.'‘

Having established that the vernia is sandarac, the “vemice
liquida'’ of Cennino, and of the early ltalians, is known ιο us.
Mrs. Merrifield in ber translation of this author¹ refers in a note
to this fact. Cennino, therefore, gives the receipt for making the
‘⁴ vernice liquida'’ in the 151 cap. He singularly also shows that
the ltalians were aware of the action of metallic oxides as driers.
The directions are for making a mordent, perfect for walls, pictures,
upon glass, or iton, or anywhere.

‘⁴ Take your oil, cooked at the lire, or in the sun, by the mode
which l have before shown you. ,Grind with this oil a little white
and verdigris; and when you have ground them as with water, put
alittle vernice into it and allow all to boil together a little.''

lt appears to me that this passage has never been rightly read,
the word “vernice,” by which Cennino intended sandarac, having
been accepted as ‘⁴ varnish” or the ‘⁴ vernice liquida” itself. The
white (carbonata of lead) and verdigrise, carbonata of copper,
aeting as driers. Van Eyck could not have therefore invented
“driers” fcr the oils or varnishes used for pigmenta more than he
did the use of these materiale themselves. Itis my endeavour
here to ascertain and expose the materiale universally employed
in the studio previously to the time of Van Eyck. What that
painter probably did invent‚l have endeavoured to show in the
Preface ιο this work.

Cannino speaks of ⁴⁴ veruice liquida” in several places, yet he
gives no mode of making it unaccompanied by driers.
