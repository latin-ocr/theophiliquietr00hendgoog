were superposed. The term was retained while the process

changed, and hence the different coloured fluida used for painting
or writing‚ and which were, in either case, laid on with pencils,
⁸were still called ‘⁸ encausta.'’¹ The word ‘⁸ atramentum” hasbeen
similarly perverted. Originally representing a dark colonr or
fluid, it gradually was used to denote different coloured fluida or
“ inlrs” used for various purposesl.

The fabrication of inlr by means of “ Roman vitriol'’ (sulphate
of iron) and osk berk, (tannis acid‚) is of more recent origin,
probably a century or two before the Christian era.

Sir H. Davy‚ “ on the Papyri in the hlusenrn of Naples,”
writes-‘⁴ 1 looked in vain amongst the MSS. and in the animal
charcoal surrounding thern for vestiges of letters in oxide of iron,
and it would seem frorn these circumstances, as well as from the
omission of any mention of such a substance by Pliny, that the
Romans, up to bis period, never used the inlr of galla and iron for
writing. And it is very probable that the adoption of this inland
theoseos parchment took place at the same time; for the inlr
composcd of charcoal and a solution of glne can scarcely he made
tn adhere to the skip, whereas the free acid of the chemical inlr
partly dissolves the gelatine of the Ma, and tha whole substance
adheres as a mordent.”³

This is not certain; Pliny gives a mode for detecting sulphate
of iron in sulphate of copper by the infusion of galla upon paper3
he says ‘⁸ it instantly blackens.”⁴

Davy appears to bave overlooked the following passage iu Pliny,
which shows that acid inks were known before his time. ‘¹ Omne
antem atramentum sole perficitur, librarium gummi, tectorium
glutino admixto. Quod autem aceto liquefactum est, aegre
eluitur.”⁵

Atramentum is mentioned by Theophilus towards the close of
this chapter. Whether the “atramentum librarinm'' of Diosco-
rides, composed of three ounces of soot with one ounce of gum, (see
Dioscor. v. 183, Περὶ plassea) was intended, or the sulphate of iron,
greenvitriol, “atramentum tectorinm” of the Romans, is open to
