Or ‘⁸ Laquearia’' are what are laid over the bearna and are inter-
woven with those heams. Also laquearia are those works which
cover and ornament apartmentsr hence Josephus in v1110‚ “De
lignis celatis, opere laqueario, auroque vestitis.”

Thus, t'rom originally denoting the interwoven wood, reed, or
plaster work, the word became applied to the ornaments with which
that work was covered, and in such sensa it is used hy Theophilus.

St. isidore, L. xix. c. 12, Originum ς thus reserato laquearia.

“ Laquearia sunt quae cameram subtegunt et ornunt, quae et
lacunaria dicuntur: quod lacus quosdam quadratos vel rotundos
ligno vel gipso vel coloribus haheat pictos, cum signis intermican-
tibus.’¹

deauramus, c. 22, v. 14. “ Et facit laquearia cedrina, pingitque
synopide,'’ “ and it is sailed with cedar and painted with siaoper,”
(translated vermilion in the English v'ersion.)

Pliny tells us tlrat Pamphilus, the master of Apelles, instituted
the custom os painting “lacunaria” or the intervals between
beams or arches upon walls, and adds “ nec cameras anta eum
taliter adornari mos fuit.”

Lazos, c. 14. The Lazur of Theophilus is douhtless the male
cyanus os the Greeks, the deep blue lapis armenus, the Kuanos,
κυαιὸς, of Theophrastus, which has, as yet, been conlounded with
the lapis laznli, or Greek σάπφειρος. -

Theophrastus mentions among the valuable stones ‘'adspargas’'
“ Sapphire‚” which isos a dark dye¹, and not very different from
the male cyanus ‘⁴ κυαιὸς.” This comparison, Hill remarks, “isa
confirmation that the sapphire and cyanus are not the sarna stone,
as they are compared together3 ” it may he added that it identifies
the sapphira with the lapis lazuli, the cyanus being of two
kinds, divided into male and female, the male being os a deeper
colour². Yet Hill here unfortunately falls into error, as he re-
marks that ‘⁴ this cyanus is a gem, and is the lapis lazuli of
which ultramarina is made,'’ whereas that colour is only truly
made from the sapphira os the Greeks, thetrue “lapis lazuli.”
Theophrastus does not speak os cyanus “ as a gem” at all;
noticing that in the “carnelian ’¹ and the “lapis lyncurius”
