gernsare dirided into rnale and female ; he instances the ‘⁸ cyanus,'’
of which he is not then treating, as being divided iu the same
manner. Hill continues the error of previous commentators,
Philsnder, Dc Laet, C. Leonardus, dvc, δια, &c

Theophrastus tella us that the sapplrire was spotted, as it were,
with gold, “χρυσι’παςος.” Hill denies this to be the lapis lasuli,
following De Boot, who writes, “Quam gemman Plinius sapphi-
rum vocat, cyanus est, seu lapis lasuli,‘’a double error, divided
between both the critics.

But Theophrastus says thatl ‘⁸ The native cyanus,'’ (or lapis
armenus) ‘⁸ ιιιιιιός αὖτοφυῆς” llas ln it “ chrysocollu,'’ “ χςυσοιιόλλιιι,”
which, with the ancients, was a green oxide of copper. Hill here
admits this to mean tlre lapis armenus, attempting to avoid tlre
dilemma by making the cyanus before mentioued a “ gem,” for·
getting that there were more than one kind of “cyanus'’

ln c. 90, Theophrastus places κύαιις, cyanus, and “ chryso-
colla” among colours used hy painters.

Hill, having apparently perplexed himself, accuses Pliny of con·
fusion², and, having embroiled the question, asserts that Pliny hes
misunderstood Theophrastus. This is both unlilrcly and erroneous.
Pliny ‘¹ De Jaspidum generibus'’ l. 37. c. 9, describes cyanus,
and after mentioning, as Theophrastus, that the Egyptian kind was
“ tinctured,” proceeds, “Dividitur autern et hoc iu mares foemi-
nasque. Inest ei aliquando et aureus pulvis, noa qualis in sapphi-
rinir.” He follows with “Sseesrrnus earu ur suasis euscrrs
cosuucur. ‘⁴ Ceruleae et sapphiri, raroque curn purpura. Optime
spud Medos, nusquam tamen perlucidae,'’ hc, certainlya dis·
tinction is made here between tlre cyanus and the sapphirus.

The deep blue, “ lapis armenus ” or cyanus, is even now cut for
oruaments; some of this so closely resembles sapphirus or lapis
lasuli that it is only hy the test of lire, which destroys the blue
colour of the native carbonata of copper, the two are to be distin·
guished. De Boot³, upon lapis loculi, gives this true test of the
stone. ‘⁴ fixus lapis laauli, hoc est, qui igni impositus colorem
nonmutat.''

“The lapis laznli is permanent, that which is placed iu the
lire does not change colour, this is the legitimare proof3 it is mnstly
