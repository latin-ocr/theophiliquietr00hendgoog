brought from the East. That found in Germany is not perma-
nent, it is commonly called ‘Lasnnsusna' and this is the nlean
between the Armenian stone, which is, ftiable, and the lapis luculi,
which is equal in hardness.'’

Theophrastus, e. 71 , speaks of asandy cyanus, the “ bergblau”
of the Germane, our mountain blue.

The “Lesur-stein” or male cyanus, the deep blue lapis
armenus, is most probably the “Luam” of Theophilus.

The Persian “ Lazoard” blue, is probably the origin of the term
‘⁴ Lazur.” Beckmann states that the Persians are very fond of
ultramarina but that Persia only produces the blue copper ore,
(the male cyanua) and that the real lapis lazuli is found in the
mountains of Tartary in Eucharist, extending eastward from the
Caspian¹.

Most of the mediaeval writers have confounded the lapis la·
auli, the lapir armenus, blue jasper coloured with carbonates and
arseniates of supper, mountain blue‚ the one with the other, and
errors have arisen which even now are to be dispelled.

But there were factitious blues used by the ancients in pointing.
Theophrastus tells us that “the Egyptian Kuanos was factitiouS,
end that the historiens think worthy of a place in their annals,
the king of Egypt who was the inventor of the artificial cyanus.”²
It was the wrong translation of the second sentence in this chapter
by Hill, which led to his confusion and his wroragful denunciation
of Pliny. “There are three kinds of Cycnus,” Hill has trans--
lated ‘⁶ there are three kinds of rtis? which he thus makes rela-
tive to the ‘⁶ factitious” Egyptian kind just before mentioned.
Pliny avoids this error, yet mentions, like Theophrastus, all the
kind together. The “Caerulea'’ of Pliny are all factitious kinds³,
which Sir H. Davy thinks preparatione of blue carbonates and
arseniates of copper.”⁴ Vitruvius, however, gives the composi·
tion of the Egyptian blue. ‘⁶ Arena cum natri (or nitri) flore con-
teritur, adeo subtiliter ut efficiatur quemadmodum farina, et aeri
Cyprio limis,’' δικ the different MSS. have both “nutri’' and
“ nitri.'' Thus saud, carbonate of soda, to form the glass, and
the colouring matter copper lilings‚ were the component parts of
