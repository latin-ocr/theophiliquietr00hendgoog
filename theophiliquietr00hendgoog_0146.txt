the Alexandrian blue, afterwards rnade at Pozauoli and used, Davy
tells' irs, in the Baths os Titus and in the llldobrandine marriage.
These arures had not changed at all. ln an excavation made at
Pompeii, at which Davy was present, a small vase was found filled
witha pale blue calcar, which Davy asserta was “a mixture os
lime and Alexandrian frit?

Other aaure colours were made by the Greek artiats for the
purpose of painting arrd illuminating.

ln a collection os medical and other recipes at the andos the
MS. os Theophilus, and which have not been written later than the
commencement ol the thirteenth century. I lind two very curious
modes of making “ararium'' the first of which is made from
ailrer, and is, Iconsess, to me, incomprehensible, aa an oxide os
silver would be the result of the process instead of a blue colour.
The second is from copper. Igive the text for the curioua.

“ Accipe ollam novam et mitte in eas laminas purissimi argenti
quantas volueris, et pone illam ollam in vindemiam quae est pro-
jecta de torculari sive de tina, et cooperi ollam cum laminis de
ipsa vindemia et serva diligenter nsque nd xv. dies, et sic aperies
ollam illam, et siccata quod est in laminis, rade in mundissimo

“Accipe ampullam de purissimo cupro et imple fortissimo aceto,
et cooperi diligenter oa ejus, ne aliquid humoris vel vaporis possit
exire, et addens si necesse est ad hoc, tenacem terram vel pastam,
et ipsam ampullam ita clausam pone in aliquo calido loeo ant in
terram aut in foenum projectum de stabulo et sic dimitte per unum
mensem et tunc aperi illam ampullam et quod inveneris in ea
dimitte ad solem siccare.”

Thia last recipe would form an oxide of cnpper, which hythe
continued action of the aeid would become asub-acetate; this, de·
composed by lime, would yield verditer.

These recipes are found frequently among the notices upon
:olours os the Byzantina school, the silvei being used alone, but*
