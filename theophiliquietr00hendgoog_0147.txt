the copper being directed to be used with sal ammoniae and wine
lees, by Dioniaius¹, and with lime and vinegar by Petrus de St·
Audemar², thus procuringa verditer.

Gener-³, in his notice os silver, tells us that, “exposed to the
contact of aeid vapours and ot sal ammoniae, it takes a beautiful
violet colour.'' Any colour, however, procured l‘rom silver, on
⁶ account of its liability to suffer hom hydro-sulphureus vapours,
would be very little permanent. Pure silver, however, will not
take tbia colour under such circumstances.

Lruaus, c. to. ln the Synonyma Magistri Johannis de Gar-
landia, written in the eleventh century, the word Limbus is de-
scribed as meaning the ornament upon the border os a garment.
ln C. 60. L. 3, Theophilus directe that the names of the Apostles
be inscribed on the limbos or borders surmonnting the figures
-“ Quorum nomina scribes in limbo.‘' The Greek artista wrote
the name ol the personage represented either on the nimbus or
glory‚or on the limbus surronnding it, as the Greeks were for·
bidden to reverence unknown imagea.

Mnnrsc, c. 14. ln tbe table of synonimes “ Menesch,” is stated
to be a red colour darker than minium and lighter than sinoper3
the hue ol indigo is likewise attributed to it. The juice from the
berries of the elder was also called “ Menesch,’¹ “ Succos est color
trahens ad indicum. Alii dicunt esse rubeum, minus clarum quarn
minium et magis clarum qnam sinopis; et aliter vocatur meneseh
quod aliterdicitur ipse menesch csse succus sambuci.” Idem. Theo-
philus calls the drapery made with ‘⁶ succus folii ” “Violaticum.”

The word Menesch is Greek, the Romaic “ Μινεξίς” signifying
“violet colour3 ” from this word probably the Turkish ‘¹ mene-
wiche‚” purple colonr, has arisen. That a violet colour would
coincide with the directions for the use of manisc by Theophilus
is evident, for it is used mixed either with folium, or a little black
eudred, as a ground sor adrapery, manisc and lazur, and, lastly,
pure lazur being used to lighten it. It is likewise used in con-
junctiou with orpiment aa a ground, upon which more orpiment is
used asa middle tint and pure orpiment as a high light; the violet

colonr would'most effectually neutralize the pure yellow of the
