orpiment. Again, in the imitation ot the rsinhow,c.16, maniae,
as aviolet colour, is conjoined with cinnabar and with yellow,
both of which it would carry out3 in the same chapter directions
are given to shade ruanisc with solium, a little blaclr being added
at the extremity. It is' evident that it isa tender colour, as teneda
is directed to be first laid on if used upon walls, and the word sp·
pears to imply that class ol colours posscssing ariolet tint rather ⁸
than indicative oi any particular substance. I have found receipts
for the manufacture os s bluish or violet colour from the petala
ol the violet flowcr, which would be little permanent, and which
has probably, as woad, disappesred aster the introducticn of
indigo.

accurately described the miltos und cinnabar of the Greeks, he
has made no mention of minium or the “ red oxide ot* lead.''

A great confusiones terms has unfortunatel y occurred amongst
the ancient writers with respect to minium, end numerous errors
have arisen froru the reproduction of these inaccuracies. The
minium os the Romans was sometimes our “vermilion,'’ or
‘¹ sulphurct of mercury,” sometimes our “minium'' or “prot-
oxide of lead,” sometimes the “ red ochres,'¹ aa the “minium ,
sinopium '¹ of Pliny.

Dioscoridca¹ signalises this error. ‘⁴ Some erroneously believe
that minium is identical with cinnabar,” &c The minium of
Dioscorides was produced from a galena. “ ΙῖοιΒ minium is made
from an argentifcrous stone mixed with sand.'’ Wss this the
“artificial cinnabar '⁹ os Theophrastus invented by Callias the
Athenian in the reign oi Praxibulus, only nincty years before his
time³i This would account sor the confusion oi terma.

The “minium '¹ manufactured from cerussa is called ‘⁴ sandyx ”
by Dioscorides, L. 5, c. 57. This term for minium was adopted
alierwards in Italy, as Hieron. Cardenus says that minium was
also called ‘⁶ sandyx,'' and that “sandix '' was a term also applied to
burnt ochre; and in the much quoted line of Virgil,

“ Sponte sud sandyx pascentes vestiet agnos,”

This latter colour would seem to bc intended, rather than
