“ red arsenio '' or “red lead.” See also Coesalpinus, de Metellis,
L. 3, c.14. Hodie⁸sanrlycem, id est Cerussam ustam quousque
ut rubentem acquiescerit, vulgo minium vocant.

The minium of Vitruvius is a cinnabar. For in his chapter
on “The consideration of Μίιιίιιιιι,”1 hc says, “Foditur gleba,
quta anthrax dicitur” “emittit lachrymas argenti vivi.” An-
thrax was a term applied hythe Greeks to gerris or rare stones
os a red colour; Vitruvius evidently applics it to the native cinna-
bar, as “it yields dropa ot quicksilver.'' He calls the minium of
the moderns, or red prot-oxide of lead, “ sandaracha.”² “Cerussa
vero curn in fornace coquitur, mutato colore ad ignis incendium
efficitur sandaracha.”

But Pliny, better informed upon these points, tells us thata
minium is made from a veined stone, srorn which also silver is
extracted, not from that whose liquid we call quicksilver3 ” galcna
is evidently intended, as it is by Dioscorides ³. Yet he tells us
that minium is called cinnabar by the Greeks, ‘⁸ and that a minium
called also cinnabaris is produced in the mines os Spain,'’ as at
this day.

An inferior minium, the “minium secundarium ’¹ ot* Pliny, was

made by grinding the burnt and exhausted lead ore, of a red
colour.

Iu a chamber in the Baths os Titus a bright red was found in
an earthen vase. This was analysed by Davy, who found that it
sused into litharge, consequently that it was the true “minium '²
or red prot-oxide of lead ⁴.

When massicot is calcined in a reverberatory furnace, it gradually
assumes a dark purple colour; when this has taken place, the
doors should be closed, allowing the air to enter very slowly. The
longer the process ο1 cooling the liner is tho minium, and the
colour is heightened il it is kept constantly stirred, as more oxygen
is imbibed. The quantity os oxygen taken up by the lead is enor-
mous. 1 have been assured by a practical chemist, that twelve
parts ol' lead, by weight, produce thirteen of minium, if the pro-
cess has been properly conducted.
