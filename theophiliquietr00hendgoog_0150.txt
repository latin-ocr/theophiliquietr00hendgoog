Murro Recenrr, c. 2. Emeric David² isin error when he af-
lirms that Theophilus gives directions for pointing in “fresno'’
The blunder os supposing all pointings, executed upon awall, that
were not accomplished with an oily vehicla, has been lately re-
marked elsewhere.

Theophilus mentions pointing upon wall, “ in muro,'' and upon
ceiling or plaster work, “ in laqueari.” ln the former style par·
ticular colours are tube used, mixed with lime to make thern
bind, “propter firmitatem? chap- 16. 'the dry wall, “murus
siccus,” is saturated with water, end the colours applied while it
is wet The whole dries together, c. 15. This was the Byzantine
mode of pointing upon walls, “in humido,” and is quite adif-
ferent process from that known by the name of “ iresco,” which
was os Italian invention. When dry and firm, these paintings re-
ceived glazings os the rerer colours upon thern, mixed with egg,
or other glarea.

Muao‚euorrouorrworrun1v,c. lb. 1 have remarlred elsewhere
that Emeric David is in error when he states that Theophilus gives
directions ior pointing in freseo. Theophilus nowhere instructs
usin the art of fresco pointing, properly so called and so under-
stood by the Italians at a later period, and byns as “suesco
buono,'’ or true fresco. Although painting upon walls was much
in use during the latter period os the Roman empire³ and was

Ι employed in every possible place by the early Christiane in the
decoration of their temples, and lime was used with the first
colours laid upon the well moistened wall for permanency‚ “ prop·
