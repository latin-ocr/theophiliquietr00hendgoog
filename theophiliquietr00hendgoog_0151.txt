ter firmitatem,” and the colours allowed to dry with the wall
itself, that they might adhere, “ ut haereant,” yet this process, as
itwill be seen by consultingthe listeenth chapter of our author,
was widely different l'rom the Italian invention of a later date, by
which the colours unite with the new plaster of lime and saud and
are lixed upon the surface, yet forming part of the body of the
cernent itself. Theophilus speaksos lirne, only in connection with
murel decoration. ’

llequeno¹ thought with reason that the ancieuts were ignorant
of the style of “buon fresco,'' and that the directions of Vitruvius²
“De tectoriis operibus'' were sor colouring the sursace of the
plaster before it hardeued. lle adds that Wiukelrnaun and the
academicians observetl that at Herculaneum, when some of the
pointings were wiesbad, the colours of the figures, dre„ were re-
moved and the even smooth coloured ground only remained. Other
ligures were painted with ‘⁸ Punic wax and oil.'’ Vitruvius eer-
tainly nowhere speaks os pointing upon cernent, although he gives
directions sor colonring it.

The passage of Ptiny³ “ Ex omnibus coloribus cretulam amant
udoque illini recusant, purpurissimum, lodicum, caeruleum, meli·
num, auripigmentum, appianum, cerussa,” applicato the process
described by Vitruvius.

The phrase, however, os Theophilus ‘⁴ iu recenti rnuro'' “ upona
new wall’' cannot be overlooked. lt is not the “murus siccus'’ ol
chap. 15, but it appears to mean that “suesco'’ was intended
by Theophilus. How then to coincide the neglectos our author
in this instance with his universal care in description, it “ fresco”
were intended? Theophilus, who promises to teach us all the Greeks
knew in the art of pointing, would not, certainly, have neglected
so important a branch. The Byzantina MS. published by Muratori
is silent upon the subject, Eraclius likewise, as also the writers
collected by Le Begue; and it was not until the translation of the
Byzantina MS. from lllount Athos, published by Mons. Didrou⁴,
appeared, that any light was thrown upon it; Theophilus, although
he has spoken generally, has neglected nothing.
