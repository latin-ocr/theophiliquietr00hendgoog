“When you would paint achurch, commence by the higher por·
tions and linish by the lower. For this, you begin by placing a
ladder. 'l'hen take water in a large vase, and throw some witha
epoonagsinst the well so ss towet it. 11 thewsll is built of
earth, scrateh the earth with a trowel samuch es you css, because,
above all et the mult, the lime will detseh itsell more terdily.
Wet it again and polish the surfuce. 11 the wall is in brich, you
will wet it five or aix times, and you will make the plaster work of
lime, ο1 the thickness of two fingere and more, to retain humidity,
and to allow you to take advantage ol it. 1f the wall is in stone,
wet it only once or twice, end put s much smaller quantity ο1
plaster, for stone takes humidity easily and does not dry. During
winter, lay one coat ο1 plaster in the evening‚ and another, more
superficial, the next morning. In the line seston, do what is the
most convenient, and, aster havinglaid on the last coueh ο1 plaster,
equalise it well; allow it to tslre consisteuee, and work.”

the nimbus, repolish the surfaee well, end employ black; polish
the drapery‚ and loy on the proplasm. Try to terminate very
quichly that which you have polished; for, is you sre too terdy,
n trust will form upon the surfsce which would uot sbsorb the
colour. Work the face in the same mannen you will derign the
outline witha pieee of bone cut to a point, sud put on the flesh
