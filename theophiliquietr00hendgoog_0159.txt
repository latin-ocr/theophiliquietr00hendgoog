had painted a Conversion ol St. Paul in fresco, a picture ol three
merres in breadtlr and four in height. Twelve personages and
three large horses occupied this rather extensive field. This
painting was certainly not a masterpiece, bnt it was better than
that which would cost one of our painters, ol the second order,
l'rom six to eight months. Ι· even doubt that out· great painters,
charged with a religious composition, would execute it more uni-
lormly well ς there would be more excellencies, but more ssults
also in their work than in the sresco ol Mount Athos.

“When the picture is finished, they wait until the lime has
almost entirely dried3 they then linish the ligures. They attach
gold and silver to the nimbus and to garmerus, they enrich the
paintings with the lineet colours‚ particularly Venetian saure, and
they make the flowers and ornaments which decorate the interior

of the nimbus, the stuffs of habits, the ground of the picture. Ἴ

For this, the grosser colours, which were used to paint the ligures,
must be very dry, so that they may neither spoil the precious
colours, nor the silver or gold. The ligure linished‚ it is named.

A special artist, a writer, inserts the name of the personage iu the ,

field or nimbus, or about it: he traces upon the cartel which the
figure holds, patriarch, prophet, judge, king, apostle‚ or saint,
the consecrated legend, which the¹ ‘gulde of painting' com-
mands. Allerwards it is not touched, all is finished.

“This is what I observed with the greatest care in the church of
Esphigmeuou, ol Mount Athos. While the painter was at work
l interrogated him, aud wrote upon the spot, and as under his
dictation, whatl saw aud heard. They scarcely ever paint in oil,
because, said Father J oasaph, to paint in oil we must wait until the
plaster has become dry, and, as the colour would not penetrate
into the lime, it would be less solid.”

From these extracta it will be seen that saud or silica is dis-
pensed with in the composition ol the stucco, the peculiar action
of which, by hastening the setting of the plaster, so much annoys

the fresco painter. The binding of the lime is produced by me-
chanical means, instead of the chemical action which the process
of Vitruvius and the later ltaliaus undergoes3 this would, by re-
tarding the settiug of the cernent, obviate the necessity of plece-
meal work, ulrich is not spoken of in the Athos MS. The
