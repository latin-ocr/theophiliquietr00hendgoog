oi dax, skilsnl in the arta and in medicine, they could not have
overlooked the production oi an oil from the linseed nor have
been ignorant of its peculias properties.

In the British Museum arestone sculptured ligures which are
Egyptian, and have been painted with an „unornoos vehicle whioh
appears to have been oil. Two seated figures painted in different
solome, one of them red, particularly show this. Compared with
the pointings on a fragment of wall opposite to these ligures, and
which are also Egyptian, the differenee of the vehiole ean, even
at this lapse of time, be plainly observed.

Dioscorides, and the Arah writers on medicine who follow him,
spesk ol' linseed oil.

The corruption ol the word “encaustic’? has already heen re· ¹
marked, “see Incaustnm;” and the signatore “irisae,”¹ or
⁸⁸ eneoausen,'' os the Greek amiate, might well lose its orignal sig·
nification in pointin'g also; the term remaining while the process '
changed. Pamphilus, the master oi' Apelles, is stated to have in-
trodnoed many novelties into the art3 he is asserted by Pliny to
have painted iu a different style from former painters and to have
hoen in the habit oi pointing small tahlet pictores ². These re-
marks, however vague‚ coupled with the invention ol the “atra-
mentum '' oi his pnpil, Apelles, may cause us to enquire whether
‘⁸ oil '' was unknown to Pamphilus?

The first mention l can lind os the use ol oil in pointing is by
Vitruvius ³, who direets that Pnuio wax be mixed with oil in the
preparation ol walls l'or receiving eolonm, and for the application
oi colours, whioh will not bear lime, in coating walls. This is an
encaustio process, however.

Pliny gives the same directions as Vitruvius ⁴. This author
likewise mentions walnut oil by the Greek term “ Caryinum.”⁵

The Roman writers drew their knowledge upon these subjecta
from the Greeks, who were their masters in all the arts of luxury
and eleganoe; more inventive and theoretical than the Romans,
these propagated the literature, sciences and arte, which the latter
did bnt practieally adopt. It is in a Greek (Byzantina) MS. that
