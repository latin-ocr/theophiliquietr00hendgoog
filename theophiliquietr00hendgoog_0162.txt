the first positive direction for the nse os linseed oil‚ as avehicle
for paint and a varnisb, is found.

This MS. is stated by Muratori¹ to be of tho eighth century;
it is rather carelessly given by him, contains, directions sor dyeing
skins, making coloured glass, the composition of colours, varnishes,
dre„ and a description of various substanees used in the arts.
Liuseed ollis thus noticed in it. “Lineleon, ex semine lini fit,”
p. 372, is the λινηλεον of Dioscorides and the λιιὸλαδου of the mo·
dem Greeks3 linseed oil.

The recipe sora composition sor pigmenta or varnish is given.
“De compositis Linei,” p. 380. “Compositi03 Lineileunr lb. 11.
gumma ÷ (sescuncia) resina suppini ÷ 1. Omnia trita, de-
coquantur in vaso terrae.”

“The composition of Lineunr.” Linseed ott, 2lb.; gum san-
darach, ll}- Larch (or Venice) turpentine resin, ΗΖ. All
ground, they are coolred in an earthen vessel.''

There is no doubt here of an oil remisit, or vehicle which nas
used by the Greek painters. Again, “De Lineleo.'' “Linelcon
enarratione, Lineleon liber 11. gumma ÷, resina ÷ crocus soli·
‹lns lle. Ista tritaet commisce, quemadmodum superius.”

‘⁶ Of Lineleon.” “Linseed oil inspiranted, (quasi ab exareo, to
wax dry,) or boiled linseed oil, atb.; gum sandaracb, ll& pine
resin, 1th solid yellow, ab. These, ground and mixed together
as above.’' lt this crocus solidus is the yellorv aloes, it is s var-
nish which has been much in use at a later period-in Italy. It may,
however, be an ochre, and the composition one for laying on gold,
it proves, however, the mixture of varnish with colours, and it is
every curious circumstance, that at a very early period in Eng-
land painters were called “ gilders.”

The composition of a varnish which is called ⁸‘ lucidis ” is a
singular mixture, some of the ingrediente given not being, under
any circumstances, soluble in oil. l give the whole chapter for
the carious.

“De lucide ad lucidare. Super colores quale fieri debet.”
The neights are in sescunciae, ÷, or ll ounce. “Lineleon ÷ 1V.
