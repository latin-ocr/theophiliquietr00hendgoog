Eraclius, the next author upon this theme, probably of the ninth
or early in the tenth century, speaks of linseed oil, and of its use
with colours, in a more decided manner, in the MS. of John Le
Begue, in the treatise entitled “Liber tertius et prosaicus Eraclii
antedicti, de coloribus et artibus predicens· ,

The Le Begue collection from Eraclius, however, contains
many chapters which are wanting in the Cambridge MS, which
only gives one chapter not to be found in the Paris MS, “De
plumbacione auri vel Argenti.” p et. These chapters have all the
proofs of authenticity, and are the source from which many of the
early MS. writers have drawn. ’

“ De oleo, quomodo aptatur ad distemperandum colores.'' “Cal-
cem in oleo mensurate pone, et illud despumando, coque3 cero·
aiom in eo secundum quod de oleo fuerit pone, et ad solem per
mensem vel amplius frequenter removendo pone; scito quod
quanto diutius ad solem fuerit tanto melius erit. Postea cola et
serva, et colores inde distempera‚”

“Pur lime into oil by degrees and boil it, skimming it; put

¹ sun for a month or more, frequent-ly stirring it; know that the ’
longer it hasbeen in· theson, so much better it will be. Aster-
wards strain it and keep it, and distemper colours with it.”

This is every curicus aa well as valuable passage. It is not
only a proof of the attainment of a great perfectiori in the art of
painting ‘⁴ oil ’' as a material for tempering colours in pointing, but
it is almost as good a formula for the preparationof a drying oil as
could at this day be given. A patent has lately been taken out for
treating oil with fresh alacked lime during the process of preparing
sdrying oil with the per-oxide of lead; we here find tbe same
means employed during the ninth or tenth century, probably long
before that time, for it was impossible that the Greeks could have
overlooked the action of the metallic oxides of lead or zinc upon
oil of linsced: the “ plumbum combustum et oleum‚'' ‘⁴ massicot, or
minium and oil,” of Cornelius Celeus and the other Roman
writers on medicine, produced effecte which could not have been
overlooked. Marcellus, who wrote under the empire of Marcus
