Aurelius, has given a singular recipe for a “ drying oil” for the
time in which hc wrote; although not intended aa such2¹

“ Oleum vetus, quantum mittendum fuerit pro modo specierum
supra scriptarum, mittes in ollam novam, et calefacies leni flamma
vel potius igne, tuuc mittes, sed paulatim et manu inspergens,
lythargyrum bene tritum, et assidue spathomela agitabis, postea
aut picem brutiam tritam mittes,”² dre.

In describing the method of pointing on wood or stone, Eraclius
directs that the wood or stone bc well dried in the sun or at the
lire, aster this, white oil colour ia ιο be painted over it two or three
times with aflat brush; afterwards it isto be primed with the

Ι hand or brush with a thick white oil paint3 this, when half dry, is

to be smoothcd with the hand, until all is as smooth aa glass: he
adds, “you can then paint upon it with all colours distempered with
05¹st “ tunc vero desuper poterisdc omnihus coloribus et cum oleo
distemperatis pingere.” Nothing can lte clearer than this; and
that pictorial or other ornamental work is intended, is evident, for
he follows with a direction for “ marbling,” “if you prefer it ς ” the

Ι whole afterwards to bc varnished in the sun.

Theophilus, however, who professes to teach ‘⁸ all that Greece

lrnew in the art of painting,'¹ ends all doubt upon the subject of the
employment of “oil colours'' for pictures in his twenty-sixth
chapter. Upon avarnished ground of tin leaf fitted upon wood he
directa—‘⁸ Take the colours which you wish ιο lay on, grinding
thern carefully in linseed oil, without water, and make the tints of
countenances and draperies, as you have done above, with water;
and you will vary with their colours bessts, birds, or leaves, as it

may please you.” The reluctance to part witha long received
impression must therefore be set aside: and it must be allowed that
the Greeks certainly, most probably the Egyptians, lrnew the ad-
vantage of oil as a vehicla for pigmenta. ,

ln the MS. from Mount Athos a recipe ior preparing a drying
oil is given. The oil intended is most likely linseed, but Ι hav'e
