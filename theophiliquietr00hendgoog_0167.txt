ltalisns, the ‘¹ moreau'' of the French, and our ‘⁴ murrey.” Posc
and Πύεος are therefore derived from the sarae source.

In the Tab. Voc. Syn. we have ‘⁴ Morellus, est color'ex rubeo
et nigro factns;'' this is our murrey. The puros or 10010110
appears to hsve dissppeared upon the introduction 01 indigo.

The γλόκατμα or “ solleuing” of Pertselinos¹ is thus composed:
‘⁶ Glycssm.” ‘⁸‘ Tslre two parts 01 flesh colour, aud one part, ora
little less, of proplasm, (a darlr shade colour,) unite thern in a shell,
and you will heve a glycasm which will serve you for making the
fleslr you wish.”

ln the same MS. the ‘⁴ proplasm” 11ρό πλάσμα 01 Pauselinos²,
which is correlative with the second ‘⁴ porc'’ of Theophilus, is thus
composed: “Take white, ochre, green, black (the proportious are
1011 to the judgme'nt of the artist). Grind all this together upons
marble, and gather the mixture into a small bottle, to imbue the,
places where you wish to paint flesh.”

This proplasnr of Pauselinos shows that he painted differently
11010 the method given hy Theophilus, who superposes the shadow
colours, while Pauselinos painted into, or upon, his shadows.

Peusclinos ol Thessalonica, e painter os the twelsth century, was
the Raphael or Giotto os the Byzantine school³.

Pnssruus, c. l. The “prasious'’ os the Greelrs was a green
earth, or jasperlr πράσον, porrurm the Catholicon calls “praeis''
or ‘⁶ prasim'’ “creta viridis,” a green challr or clay, and prasius,
“ lapis viridis,’' a green stone. St. lsidore writes ‘⁴ prasina,’' thet
is, green clay, which is produced in different places, the best, how-
ever, in Lybie Cyrenesi. (Lybie Cyrenes, called hy Ptolom. Pen-
tapolis, l'rorn the live cities it contained. Africa.)

The prasinus 01 Theophilus appears to be an acetate of copper,
01 which “consection '' he gives the recipes at the end 01 this first
hoolr. Theophilus afterwards mentions “ succus,” and “viridis”
which appears to be “terra verte.”

lu the Sloane MS. 1754, there is the following passage: ‘⁴ Viride
