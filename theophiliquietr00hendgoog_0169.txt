As this chapter immediately follows the mention 01 colours
ground in oil, aad the composition 01 33 011 varnisb, it is more
than probable that, considering also tlte nature 01 tbe work, these
saddles, 833, were painted iu oil colours, and, ss directed, after·
warde varnished.

ln the reign 01 Henry ll.‚ (1154-1189,) Henry de Blois,
archdeacon of Barth, and chsplain to the king, exclaims against
the luxury indulged in by the military men 01 bis time, and
censuras the ostentation of some 01 these barons: “They carry
shields into the field so richly gilded, that they present tbe pros-
pect 01 booty rather than 01 danger to the enemy, and they bring
them back untouched, and, as I may ray, in a virgin state. They
also cause both their shields and saddles to be painted with the
representatione 01 battles and equestrisn combats, that they may
plesse their imaginatione with the contemplation 01 333333 13

was dug in Cappadocia, but carried to Sinope for sale; also, “that

another paler the third 01 3 middle colour between the two, which
was called the pure and simple kind, because it was used without
mining, whereas they mix the others.''² He adds, “ there is 3130
akind 01 sinoper made from ochra, by burning, the invention 01
Cidias, who observed that some ochre, in 3 house on lire, wbeu
hals burnt assumed a red 30103ῐ.”1 Sinopis thus became a gene·
rsl name for all the red ochreous earths or reddles, the ‘⁴ miltos'’
01 the Greeks, and “ rubrica'' of the Romans.

The Μιλτος 01 Theophrastus is certainly no other tban the red
ochreous earth or ore which owes its eolour to iron. He gives
the different varieties 01 miltos, and tells us that ‘¹ tbe best carne
