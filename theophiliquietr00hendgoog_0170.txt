for it is also sometimes found in tbe iron mines. There are also,
besides these, the Lemnian aad Sinopis miltos; there are par·
ticular pits in Lemnos, in which nothing but the earth is dug.”¹

The Lemnian miltos must not, however, be consounded with
the “comta’' or “terra sigillats.'' The scaled earth, used in
medicine, was an unctuous clay, of apale red colour, which was
mixed hythe priests alone, with the blood of goats sacrificed,
and then scaled by thern. lt was the‘ ‘Lemnian reddle,'’ not the

“Lemnian eartbss’ which was used by painters. Pliny con-

Salmasius was the first to detect an important error in the
different editions os Pliny, and to restore a passage, according to
his judgment, to the original intention of the author ⁴.

The passage ⁵, “Milton vocant Graeci minium, quidam cinna-
bari,’' “ the Greeks call minium miltos, some cinnabar,” hasbeen
restored by him to “(llubicam) milton vocant Groeci, minium que
cinnabari;” a statement which would be certainly correct, and
therefore fairly attributable to Pliny, many os whose “errore''
hare been more the mistakes ol his commentatore than bis own.

Salmasius thus restores the whole passage: “Jam enim Tro·
janis temporibus rubrica in honore erat, qui naves ea commendat,
alias circa picturas, pigmentaque rarus, milton vocant Groeci,
miniumque cinnabari.” 'l'he milton certainly relatas to the ru·
brica. Hrll remarks rhat‘ ‘,Homer speaking os the species
ships,w writes ‘Nisaia paroragisva 'and that rt is impossible he
should mean by' rt that they were stained with minium or cin-
nabar, which was not known till aster. his time.”

'l'his correction of an error which has so long existed, and
been variously propagated, is certainly important. Sinoper or
miltos has been used as a colour srom time immemorial‚ and we
have prool that the Egyptians used it: the Assyrians likewise.
Esekiel, c. xxiii, v. 14, speaks of “men portrayed upon the wall,
the likeness of the Chaldaeus portrayed with sinoper.” The
