it is therefore “sinopen'’ not “vermilion,” which is intended,
and which latter is given in our translation. Jeremiah, c. xxii..
v. 14, “ It is ceiled with cedar, aud painted with ‘⁴ vermilion;” it
should be rendered “sinopen'’

Some os the varieties os hamatite outwardly resemble mineral
cinnabar: hence another source of error, which the observant have
been caresul to point out.

Our own country produces ss line varieties of sinoper as any.
Hill states¹, that the reddle sometimes sold in London, under the
name os Indian red, was much the lineat he had ever seen, and
was from among the iron ore in the forest cf Dean, and not from
areddle pit: it was not inferior to that of Onnua in the Persian
(tulf, so much valued aa ludian red.

1 hope to have an opportunity os showing, in aworlt now in
prognes, that this English colour has been much appreciated, and
was famous during the best periodo οἲ the art in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries.

De Boot thus notices this variety¹: “Haematitis a sanguine
nomen habet, Germanice ‘Bluet-stein’ vocatur. Quanquam in·
terdum niger, interdum flavus, interdum ferri colorem habeat.
Strias antimonii instar hebet. Dum uritur, minii colorem imi-⁸
tatur. Habet cinnabari similem colorem.'’

Theophrastus describes the Hoematite ⁸, aa “ dense, solid, dry,
or, according to its name, seeming ss if formed oi concrcted
blood ς ” headda, “there is also another kind of it called xanthus,
which is not oi the eolour of the former, but oi a yellowish white,
which colour the Dorians call xanthus.'’

As the yellow ochres are “hydrates oi iron,”so are the red

ochres “oxides of iron,” and in proportion to tlte quantity of
oxygen contained in the substance the deeper does the colour
become. The trit-oxide, or purple aride, is the highest point ot*
oxidation. The greater proportion of clay which the yellow or
red ochres possess, the brighter will be the colonr. Our sinoper
is a compact heavy substance ofa deep red colour, soiling the
lingere when handled, and answering to our lndian red.
