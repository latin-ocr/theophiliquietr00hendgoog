PREFAOE

ΤΗΕ SECOND BOOK.

N the preceding book, decrest brother, through a
disposition of sincere affection, I have not hesitated

to convey to your virtuous disposition how much honour
and perfectiori there is in avoiding indolence, and in
contemning ignorance and sloth; and how sweet and
agrceable it is to indulge in the exercise of divers use-
fulness after the word osa certain author, who says :—

⁴⁴ To know anything is praiseworthy3 it is a fault to be unwilling
to learn.”

Nor let any one be slow to understand him, concerning
whom Solomon hos said, “ He that increaseth know-
ledge increaseth labour,'' because whoever carefnlly
meditates may mark what perfectiori of mind and body
may result from it.

For it is evident3 clearer than the light; because
whoever gives his mind to sloth and levity, also indulges
in vain tristes, and slandcr, curiosity, drinking, orgies,
quarrel, light, homicide, excesS, thefts, sacrileges, per-
jnry, and other things of this kind, which are repugnant
in the eyes of God, overlooking the humble and quiet
man, working in silence in the name of the Lord, and
obedient to the precept of the holy Apostle Paul:
“But rather let dim laboro, worlcinq with dis Modo lde
thing which is· pond, rial de moy doce to pino to dim thot

ncedetd.''
