Pharroa ro rna secono noon. 117

Ι, desiring to ba the imitator of this man, have
approached the poroh of holy Sophia, and beheld the
ohaneel filled with every variety of divers colourS, and
showing forth the nature and utility of each. From
which having forthwith entered with unwatehed foot-
step, Ι filled up the storehouse ol my heart fully, out
of all; which Ι have aet forth with elearness, having, by
eareful experiment‚ thoronghly examined one by one
for your study, all these things suffiaierrtly approved hy
the eye and hande, without jealonsy. But sinea the
practice of this kind oi embellishnrent cannot be of
quick apprehension‚ like a diligent inquiret I have
greatly laboured to inform mysolf, by all methodo, what
invention of art and variety of eolour may beantifya
structure and not rapel the light of day and tho raya of
the sun. Applying myself to thia exordiae, Ι comprise
the nature of glass, and Ι consider that this oan be

effected by the use and variety of it alone. This art,
as seen and reported Ι have learned, Ι have lahoured,
for your observance, to fathom.
