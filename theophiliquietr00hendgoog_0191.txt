CHAPTER VI.

HOW GLASS TABIAETS ABE MADE.

lrr the morning, however, at the first hour, take the iron tube,
and, if you wish to make platee of glase, place the end of it
in a vase lull of glasa; when ithae adhered to it, turn this
tube round in your hand until aa much as you may wlsh has
accumulated around it; then, withdrawing it, bring it to your-
mouth and blow slightly, and instantly removing it from the
mouth, hold it near your cheek, unless, in drawing breath,
you may by chance attract the flame into yourmouth. Have
also a llat stone before the window upon which you beat this
glowing glase a little, that it may hang equally on every side,

immediately and with quicknesa, repeatedly blowing, eo often .

you remove it from the mouth. When you aee it look like a
long bladder, bring the end of it towards the fleme, and,
being instantly melted, an opening will appear, and, the piece
of wood fitted for this work being taken, make the opening
aa wide as ia the glase in the middle. Then join its mouth
together, namely, the upper to the lower part, so that on both
eides ol the junction an opening may appear. Instantly
touch this gloss near the tube with a moist piece of wood,
shake it a little, and it will be separated. Presently also beat
the tube in the llame of the fornace, until the glase attached to
it liquely, and, with rapidity, place it upon the two conjoined
borders ol gloss, and it will adhere; directly taking this up,
put it into the fleme of the hrrnace until the opening, whence
you formerly separated the tube, is liquefied, and the round
piece os wood being taken, dilate it aa the other, and folding
together its mouth in the middle and separating it from the
pipe with the molat wood, gire it to the boy, who, introducing
a piece of wood through the opening. will carry it to the
cooling' oven, which is made moderately warm. This kind ol'
glossis pareandwhite. ln the same manner, aud at the
sometime, make similar pleces of gloss until you exhaust the
vases.
