lu the ancient edifices of the Pagans, different kinds of glass
are found in mosaic work, namely, white, black, green,
yellow, sapphire, red, and purple; itis not clear, but opeque,

sapphire in their furnaces, adding to it a little clear and white
glass, and make costly platee of sapphira, and very useful in
windows. They work also from the purple and green ina
similar manner.
