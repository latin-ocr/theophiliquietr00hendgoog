CHAPTER XVII.

ou COMPOSING WlNDOWS.

When you wish to compose glass windowS, first make for
youreell a flat wooden table, ol such breadth aud length that
you can work upon it two portione of the same window; aud
taking chalk, and soraping it with a knife over ull the table,
sprinkle water everywhere, and rub it with a cloth over the
whole. And when it is dry, take the dimensione of one por·
tion of the window iu length and breadth, marking it upon
the table with rulo and compass with the lead or tin3 ond il
you wish to have a border init, portray it with the breadth
which may please you, and in the pattern you may wish.
Which done, draw out whatever ligures you will, first with
the lead or tin, theu with a red or black colour, making all
outliues with study, because it will be necessary, when you
have painted the gloss, that you join together the shadows and
lights according to the (drawing on the) table. 'lhen arrang-
ing the different tints of draperies‚ note down the colour of
each one in its plaoe; aud ol any other thing which you may
wish to paint you will mark the colour with aletter. Alter
this take a lenden cup, aud put chalk, ground with water,
into it: make two or three penoila for yourself from hair,
either from the tail of the marten, or badger‚ or squirrel, or
cat, or the mane of the ase, and take a piece of glans of whet-
ever kind you like, which is iu every way larger thau the
place upon which itis superposed, and hiring it in the ground
of this place, so that you ean perceive the drawing upon the
table through the glass, so portray with the chalk the outlines
