be unable to perceive any light between them. Afterwards
you will separate them from one another, and, taking your
rule, make two lines in the middle of one piece, and two in
the middle of the other opposite, small in breadth from top to
bouum, and hollow thern out with the chasingiron, with which
lampa are hollowed out, as deep as yon wish‚ and rasp a
little inside between the two lines in both pieces of iron‚ so
that when you pour the lead into them one piece may be
made. But you will so arrange the mouth into which it is
poured, that oue part ol the iron may be coupled to the other,
that it cannot slip during the casting.
