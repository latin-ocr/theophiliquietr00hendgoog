CHAPTER XXV.

OF GAS'l'ING THE RODS.

Aorsn these things make a hearth for yourself where yon can
melt lead, and in the hearth a hollow, in which you cao
places large earthen vessel, which you line insidc and out
with clay beat up with dung, that it rnay be the more firm,
⁵ and light a large lire over it. And when it has become dry
place the lead upon the lire inside the pot, that, when itis
liquefied, it may flow into it. ln the mean time, opening the
rod-mould, place it over the charcoal, so that it may become
warm3 and you must have a piece of wood ayard in length,
which is round attho end which is held in the hand, but at the
other flat and wide, to the size of four fingers, where it is cut
across as lar as the centre, according to the breadth ol the
iron, in which incision you place this mould hot and closed
together, and you will so hold it in the upper part with the
hand slightly bent back, that, in the lower part, it may stand
upon the ground, and taking the small iron spoon warmed,
take out the liquefied lead, and pour it into the mould: and
immediately place the spoon upon the fire, that it may be
always worm, and casting the mould from the wood upon the
ground, open it with a knife, and taking out the rod again,
shut it and replace it in the wood. lf, however, the lead is
not able to flow in the mould to the bottom, cast again in the
better warmed mould, and you will regulate it so that it may
become full, because if it becomes all of an equal tempera-
turc, you can cast more than forty rods with one hosting.
