round. You will then fashion two small marks outside at
each end of each piece of wood, according to the width
which you wish the rod to be between, and taking aflaxen
thread thiu and twisted, moisten it in red colour, and, separat-
ing the pieces ol wood, apply this cord upon oue inside sur-
face, from the mark which you cut at the top to the mark be-
low, so that it may be firmly stretched3 and joining the other
wood to it prese thern together strongly, so that when you
have separated them the colom may appear upon both pieces.
The thread, being taken off and again moistened with colour,
is tired upon the other mark, and you place the other wood
upon it and compress it. When the colour shall have ap-
peared upon both sides, cut the groove with a lrnife as wide
and deep as you wish, so, however, that the incision may not
pass through the lower end, but at the top, where you pour
in, it may have an opening. Which being done, join the
woods together, binding them with a strap from top to bot-
tom, and holding it with tha wood, pour in the lead, and the
strap being loosened, take out the rod. Again binding and
casting, do this until at length the buming reaches the bottom
ol the incision; and so you can afterwards cast, gently, as
osten and as many as you wish. When you see that you
have rods enough, cut a piece of wood two fingere wide and
as thick as the groove is inside, dividing itin the middle so
that at one end it is whole, and at the other there is an in-
cision, in which the rod is inserted. Cut which, placed in it,
with a knile on both sides, and smooth and serape it as it
may please you.

Tenen things being thus arranged, take pure tin and mix
with it a fifth part of lead, and cast in. the above mentioned
iron or wood as many rods as you wish, with which you will
solder your work. Have also forty nails a finger in length,
which are at one end fine and round, nt the other square, and
