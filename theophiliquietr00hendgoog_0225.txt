be pierced through, arrd instandy warm it in the fleme, and
atrike it twice upon the wood, that the glans may be dilated‚
and with quickness revolve your hand with the same iron, that
the ring may be enlarged in the circle 3 and so revolving,
make it descend as far as the whee1‚ that it may become
smooth. This being instantly thrown into the trenoh, make

to vary your ringo with other colours, when yon have taken
and transpiereed the gloss with the ¹pointed iron, take from
another vase gloss of another colour, surrounding the glass
of the ring with it in the manner of a thread3 then, warmed
in the fleme as above, finish itinn similar manner. Yon ean

also place upon a· ring glane of another kind, as egem, arrd
worm it in the flame that it may adhere.
