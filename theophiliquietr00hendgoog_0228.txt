The rand ol the Belus was probably sopnd purer than else·
where, and lit for the composition ol fine glans, and thus the
Phoenlcians first became the producere ot'a beautiful and cele·
brated white glass, the most difficult ol all, at this period, to
acquire. For, owing to the presence ol metallis oxides in the
alkaline carbonam, or the quartcous fragments, the productiori ot*
a coloured glass would be ol earlier date than a pure aad colour-
less vitrification. Theophilus provides sor the casual colouring
ol th'c “ metal ” through the mixture ol metallic oxides with its
elementa.

The divers colours ol glass not transparent, which Theophilus
tells us, c. xii, were found in the edifices of the Pagans, in mosaic
work, were doubtless oi the kind which were seen in Egypt by
M. de Roziere, and the artos making which was transmitted ιο
the Greeks. Pliny¹ remarks upon a manufacture imitating the ob-
sidian stone, “ Obsidian stone is also made in stained fashion, for
vessels of repast, and a persectly red glass and not Nor Tarus-
cucsur, called hoematinon. Wrurn is also made and Muanmuurr
(purple), or Hracrsrs and Sarrsrss, and imitation in Aac
Ornss Conouns.” In the previous chapter Pliny mentions that
pavemeuts and other ornaments in glass were used by Agrippa in
the construction ol* his batha. This kind os mosaic work, then,
served the Byzantine artists in the construction of the enamelled
vases which were so beautiful in colour and are now so rare.
These enamels are all opeque, and present the appearance of the
lineet mosaica. Theophilus tells us that white, black, green,
yellow‚ blus, red and purple gloss, found also in the form ol
utensile, were used for this work hythe French, who were al·
ready “skillul in the art ” of working glasa. Pliny, indeed,
states that Italy, Gaul, and Spain, pursued the manufacture of
glass.

This opaque glass was, doubtless, the Visatur Rouauosr ol

Eraclius, some ol whose chapters are quoted by Theophilus at the
end ol the third book.
