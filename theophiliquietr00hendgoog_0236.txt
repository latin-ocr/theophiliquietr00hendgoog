C. Xlll. AND C. XIV. “VITRUM CLARISSIMUM, VELUT
CRYSTALLUM, QUOD IPSI COMPONUNT.”

The “very clear glass like crystel'’ used by the Greeks, io
order to 1111111 gold 1111 10 usses, and which iu C. xiv. is employed
upon 10 ornament ol gold, or silver, previously laid upon glass, is
no other 111111 1111111 capable of retaining and combining, by the
action 01 lire, with the various vitreous colouring substances 11111-
wards superposed. Thia last chapter indeed proves that the
Byzantius Greeks prectised the ert 01 Parumne 01011 611111,αο
111 which ull the French writers, from Le Viel to M. Ε. Thibsud,
with perhaps 1 laudable partiality, lebour to prove 01 French
origin, 101101 the twellth or thirteenth century.

Emeric 1111111ι indeed, in exception, mentions thet 1111 historico
01 the monastery 01 St. Begnine, who wrote about 1052, declares
thet there existed, yet in hir 11011, 10 the church 01 the monastery,
every ancient 31111 window, representing the martyrdom 01 St.

Paschasie, and that this pointing hed been taken 11001 the old
ohurch, restored by Cherles the Bald, (s. o. 850,) ‘⁶ or 11010111
1111111 annonariis 110111, 11 usque ed nostra perdurans tempora,
eleganti praemonstrabat picturd.'’

The Benedictines heve ascribed this invention to the period 01 ·
Charlemegne, T. 6, p. 66, and with more reason. For Theo·
philus not only describes the ornamenting 01 cupa, vesca, and
other utensile, by means 01 coloured 31111 flused upon a white
ground; but in C. 21 are found clear directions 101 painting upon
glass. ‘⁸ In the same manner you make grounds 01 the 01111111
white, the figures 01 which grounds you ornament with sapphiro,
green, purple, 1011 red.” The dari< colour is to take the place 01
posc in marking the nude, 811.

Τ11011 01 e 111111 101 the purpose 01 ornamenting veses, whether
01 31111 01 eerthenwere, ere found scattered through the books 01
Eraclius. The art 01 rendering 31111 more lusible by means 01
litherge was well known to that writer.
