“ The calcination os tartaros red and white wine is thus made.
Wash hard tartar often in water, and place it to be calcined in a
reverberatory fornace, with little lire at first3 augment it asterwards
until it grows white inside. Then cast it into hot water in a clean
vessel, and dissolve it with a clean spatula, and when it has become
dissolved, allow it to cool. Afterwards pass it through a filter, then
bear it upon the lire and inspissate that which is strained, and aller-
ward· grind it and put it into an uncovered pot to calcina, until the
potis red hot, for one hour, perhapr; afterwards extract and grinrl
and dissolve it in hot water and expose it to ooolt afterwards
filter and evaporata, again calcine it as before another hour3 dis-
solve, evaporato, and calcina it: when it runs upon' a plate or the
surnace without sume it is then proper for melting crystal.''
