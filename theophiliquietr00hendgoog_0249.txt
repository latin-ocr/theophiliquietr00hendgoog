mented witb a erote can be hutone of tbe three Divina personages:
this, adds M. Didron, is the invariable rula.

Until the eleventh century the Latin church, as well as the Greek,
fraternizcd with the Jewish religion. An anamelled cross oi the
Abbey of Saint Bertin, aromaio cross oi* the eleventb century,
gives tbe nimbus, the character oi saint, to Moses, tobis brother
Aaron, to the prophet who marks the elect with the ‘⁴ thau,” to
Isaac, to Josbua and Calah. But nt tbe momentus the consum-
mation ol the schism, this respect, which tbe Latin church formerly
entertained sor the personages of the Old Testament, sensibly di·
minished; the Byzantina influence, alone, partially preserved it,
but in the lourteenth century the Christian saints only kept this
attribute. The Greeks continue the practice unto this day ¹.

O. XXX. QUOMODO REFORMETUR VAS VITREUM
FRACTUM.

This invention appears to have been made in the reign os
Tiberius Caesar, and to have led to the sable of malleable glast.
Pliny, who bas been quoted by St. Isidore, mentions an invention
ol a composition, or tempering, which rendered glass tendet, and
that Tiberius, fearing this would depreciate the salue oi the
precious metals, abolished the worksbop ol the artificer. This
story has been wonderfully improved by St. Isidore, who adds a
hammer to the tale, and converts the “tendet” or “ tractable gloss ”
mentioned by Pliny into one which is “malleable.” Eraclius
quotes from St. Isidore, rather than from Pliny, whose version is
too plain to admit os the marvellous.

Pliny writes, “ Ferunt, Tiberio principe, excogitatum vitri tem-
peramentum, ut flexibile esset: et totam officinam artificis ejus
abolitam, ne aeris, argenti, auri, metallis pretia detraherentur:
atique fama crebrior diu, quam certior suit.”²

St. Isidore, disregarding the doubt expressed by Pliny, that
glass could even be rendered more tractable, writes ³—“ It is re·
lated that, under Tiberius Cesar, an artificer invented a temperiny
sor gloss, which rendered it tendor and ductile ( flexibile et ductile).
