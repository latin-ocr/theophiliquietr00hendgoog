Dotena states that during the excavations at Pompeii in 1778,
the windows of soma chamherr, attached to the batha, were found
glazed with as line glass as that 01 the moderna. Lactantius¹ and
St. Jerome², writers 01 the third and fourth centuriea, both speah
os glaaed windowa. The employment 01 coloured glans arranged
in Mosaic sashion, the “fenestra simplex,” c. 29 ol Theophilus,
would soon give place to the use-of painted glans aa the art ad·
vauced. Observant 01 the effecta 01 colour productiva of such
admiration during the early efforts ol art, new exertiona, in order
to unite the beauty of pictorial effect with the previous richness 01
decoration, would douhtless soon be made to call to aid the talenta
01 the Christian artiat.

Vernaus herbida oruata saphiratos
Flectit par prasinum vitrum lapilloa.’'

Fortunatus and Paul the hermit, as well as Theophilus, de·
scribe the admirable effect which the risin'g sun produced through
the windows 01 St. Sophia at Constantinople. (See Presace to this
Book, p. 117.)

lt ia more than probable that all these early ornamenta] windows
were in the Mosaic style 01 art, and that the various gloss was
coloured by the combination 01 the metallic oxides with the glast
