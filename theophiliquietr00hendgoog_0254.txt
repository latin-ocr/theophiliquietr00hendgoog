however, are not oi the class which would turn from any inquiry
upon the subject during the present state of conflicting opinions,

when the very principles of the art which formerly led to its per·
fection are questioned, or neglected.

The principles laid down by Theophilus must be studied by the
glass painter and again placed as the foundation ot* his labours;
modern chemistry has, doubtlesa, supplied him with meana, in
many instances lar beyond what his predecessore have enjoyed, in
the pursuit ol this art, hut there are yet conditions to be lullilled
which principally depend upon himself. The glass painter should
well weigh the propriety of striving to rival the grey demi-tiata
