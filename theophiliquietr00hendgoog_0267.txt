HE most renowned of the Propheta, David-of

whom the Lord had prescience‚ and whom he prs-
destiued before mundane ages, and whom, on account of
the simplicity and humility of his mind, He elected, after
his own beart, and placed over the people of his choico,
and established with his Holy Spirit, that he might nobly
and wisely regulata the conduct appertaining to so
grem a name,-coneentrating within himself all the
power of his soul iu the love of his Maker‚ uttered
these words amongst others :-“ lond, I hooc losed tte
beocty of thy housc.'' And although it was lawful that
aman of so much authority and of such capacious in-
tellcct should eall house that habitation of heavenly
worship in which God presides in ineffable brightness

over the hymns of choirs of engeis, towards which he ·

himself yearucd with all his soni, saying‚ “ One thing
hace I desired (ff the Lorii, thal will I seelc pler: thot
I may druell in thelame of the Lord att tte days os my
lise,·” or, as the refuge of adevoted hreast and most
pure hcart, in which God truly dwelt‚ of which asylum
au intense desire again prays forth, “ Reocw c ⁹⁴2]th
spirit within me, O Lord'’-yet it is certain that hs
strongly desired the embcllishment of the material
house of God, which is the place of prayer.
