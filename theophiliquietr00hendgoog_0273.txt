gards the walis, there is the appearance of paradise ; if
it marks the abundanoe of light from the windows, it
admires the inestimable beanty of the glass and the

ἱ, variety of the most costly work. But if perchance a

faithful mind should behold 0 representation of our
Lord’s passion expressed in drawing, it is penetrated
with compunction3 it' it beholds how many sufferings
the saints have hodily supported, and how many re-
wards of eternal life they have received, it quickly
induces the observance of a better iife; if it regards
how much rejoicing is in heaven, and how much suffer-
ing in the flames of 11011, it is animated by hope 101 its
good actions, aad is struck with fear by the considera-
tion of its sins.

Act therefore now, well-intentioned man, happy be·
fore God and men in this life, happier in 0 future, in
whose lahour and study so many sacrifices are offered
up to God3 henceforth warm thyself with amore ample
invention, hasten to complete with all the stndy of thy
mind those things which are still wanting among the
utensils of the house of the Lord, without which the
divine mysteries 0011 the services of 00101000100 cannot
continue. These arethe 011011000,0001101011101000000
burners, visls, pitchers, caskets of sacred relics, crosses,
missais and other things which useful necessity requires
for the use of the ecclesiastical order.

If you wish to fabricate these, in this order you
commence.
