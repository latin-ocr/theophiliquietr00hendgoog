ΟΡ THE WORK FURNACE.

Nure the. wall, by the window, on the left side of the person
sitting, a piece ol wood is llxed in the ground (three¹ feet in
length) in width two and in thickness scarcely two lingens,
which, when itis firmly fixed, may hare a perforation in the
rnidst of the sine of a finger, lour lingere high above the
ground. Let it hove also in front a straight piece of wood
joined to it, and fixed with wooden pege, four fingere in
breadth, and the length of which is equal to the large pisce
of wood. In front of this you lasten another wood of eqnal
breadth and length, so that between these two woods there
may be espace of four fingers, and fasten that outside by two
or three stakes; and taking clay, not beaten, nor mixed with
water, but newly dng up, put at first a little of it into this
space, and compressit strongly with a rounded piece of wood,
then more, and again beat it ; and do thus until two parts ol
this space are filled, and leave the third empty. Then take
away the wood in front, and with a long knife cut the clay
evenly in sront and on the top, then with athin piece of wood
beat it strongly. After this take clay beaten and mixed with
horse dung, and make the fornace and its hearth, covering
the wall that it may not be burned hythe lire, and with a
slender pieee of wood perforate the clay through the opening
which is in the wood behind. ln this manner compose all
smith’s furnaces.
