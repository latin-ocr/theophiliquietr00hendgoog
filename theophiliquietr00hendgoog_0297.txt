CHAPTER XXVI.

Anu when you have begua to beat it, find the middle of it,
and mark a centre with the composa, and arouud it make a
aquare projection, in which you should. hasten the foot. But
when it has been made so thiu that it can he hent with the
hand, make circles inside with the compass from the centre
to the middle, aud outside, from the middle to the rim, and
with a round hammer beat it inside according to the circles,
that thus it may acquire depth, and outside with a middle-
sized (hammer) upona round auvil according to the circles
aa far as the rim, that it may thus become more narrow‚ and
do this until at length you attain lor it a form and capacity
according to the quantity of silver. Which beingdone, rasp the
inside and out smoothly with a file, and round tha mouth until it
is made even throughout. Then dividethe remaining halfol the
silver in tw0, as above, and from one portion take away the

weight of six nummi, and add it to the other from which you ⁵
make the foot, which afterwards in liling you will take away
from it and restore to its portion. And thus cast and hammer
¹ the loot, as the cup, until itis at length thinned, excepting that
you do not make a projection in it. Being thinned you will
give it depth, inside and out, with the round hammer, and will
begin to form the knot with the middle-sized hammer upon

the round auvil, and then upon one lengthened upon both sides,
until you make the neck aa slender as you wish, having a
car·eful regard to this, that you do not hammer more in one
place thau in another, that the knot may not hy chance lean
upon either eide, but stand iu the middle, everywhere equally
thick aud wide. Thau place it upon the coals and fill it with
