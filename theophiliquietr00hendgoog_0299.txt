wax, and when ithae become cold, hold the lbot iteelf
in the lert hand, and in the right an irou, yielding and thin,
and make the hoy sit near you, who cau atrike with a very

small hammer upon the iron in whatever spot you place it, .

and yon will mark the ring with it, which should be around
it between the knot and the scot. Being designed, pour
out the wax, and the soot being warmed fill it again, so that
you may hammer the ring more deeply than before; and act
thus until yon perfect it equally, with ite beads. Then file
and serape the knot, and around the foot iuside and out, and
ita brim ; and make, in the middle of the knob, a quadrangular
opening according to the size ol the projection in the upper
vase, and place in it a thick piece of eilver, round, perforated
in the same manner. Maka likewise a ring-separately, which
ought to stand between the knob and the vase above, ol the
same siae and kind ae that which you had formed under the
knob with the ductile iron, and taking a blunted iron you
will rub it upon a flat stone, then upon oak-wood, ground
charcoal being placed upon it, and with it you will polieh the
vase incide and out, the knob and foot and the ring, and you
will thus rub it witha cloth and chalk finely scraped, until
the work he made quite brilliant. These things being thus
accomplished, divide the projection of the cup iuto four, ae far
as the middle, with a thiu file, and turn it over upon a round
auvil, so that it may hang equally, and place the ring upon it,
and the projection in the opening ol the knob, and the small
piecee which are from above, and holding these with the lest
hand firmly and evenly, and in the right the ductile iron, place
them iu the knob, and cause it to be beaten with the middle·
sized hammer until you fasten it firmly. Alterwards melt the
eilver which you have tiled and scraped with that which is
lert, aud atrike out a round flat plate with the compaes, ae
large aa ie the height of the chalice from the soot below to
the mouth above, aud rather more, and beat it hollow within
according to the breadth of the vase at the top, so that it can
lie evenly upon it. And, is you wieh, draw two circlea within,
