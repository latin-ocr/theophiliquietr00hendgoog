with the compass, and portray with a blunted graver the
likeness of a lamb in the middle, or a right hand as if de-
scending from heaven and blessing, and letters between these
two circles, and hollow it finely with the sculpturing iron,
polishing it effectively, as the chalice.

CHAPTER XXVII.

Ol? THE LARGER CHALICE AND l'l‘S MOULD.

Bur if you wish to construet a large silver chalice, of four, or
six, or ten marks, you will first purify and prore all the silver
in the lire, afterwards divide it in the order above. After this
take two piaces of iren equally long and wide, of the measure
of apalm and thick as a straw, evenly beaten and without
flaw, and carelirlly smoothed with a plane: make between
these an iron binding beaten smoothly and moderately
thick, which you will bend in fashion of a eirele, of such aize
as it may be apparent to you that it can be filled with the
silver which you wish to cast in it. And when you have bant
it, do not join the ends together, but you will separate them
a little that an opening may appear through which you ean
pour in. You will adapt this circle equally between the two
iron (platee), so that itsends may appear a little beyond the
irons, and bind these with three strong iron hooks in three
places, namely, below and on each side near the opening, and
thus plaster beaten clay around the circle between the irons
and abundantly about the opening. When this mould has
become dry, you worm it and pour in the melted silvei. All
gold and silver, which is founded in this manner, is always
sound,(unless it happen through great negligence,) for working
in it whatever you may wish. You will measure the circles
also according to the quantity which you wish to found, and
you make larger and smaller: alter you have beaten out the
melted silver as above, fill it with wax and beat it on the
body, if you wish to have ribs flat or' round; these stand
aronnd like small speons, both which kinds of work gire
great ornament to the chalice.
