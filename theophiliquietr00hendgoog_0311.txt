CHAPTER XXXIII.

01² HEA'I'IIIG rus GOLD. Α

Tarra gold, of whatsoever sort it may be, and beat it until thin
leaves are made in breadth three fingers‚ and as long as
you can. Then cut out pieces that are equally long and wide,
and join them together equally, and perforate through all with
a fine cutting iron. Asterwards take two earthen pots proved
in the fire, ol such a size that the gold can lie flat in them,
and break stile very small, 0r clay of the furnace burned and
red, weigb it, powdered‚ into two equal parts, and add to it a
third part salt lor the same weight; which things being slightly
sprinkled with urine, are mixed together so that they maynotad-
here together, but are scarcely wetted, and puta little of it upon
a pot about the breadth of the gold, then a piece ol the gold
itself, and again the composition, and again the gold, which
in the digestion is thus always covered, that gold may not be
, in contact with gold; and thus fill the pot to the top, and
cover it above with another pot, thch you carefully lute
round with clay, mixed and beaten, and you place it over the
lire, that it may be dried. In the mean tirne composa a fur-
nace from stones aud clay, two leet in height, and a footand
a half in breadth, wide at the bottom, but narrow at the top,
where there is an opening in the middle, in which project
three long and hard stones, which may be able to sustain the
flame lor a long time, upon which you place the pots with
the gold, and cover them with other tiles in abundance. Then
supply fire and wood, and take care that a copious lire is not
wanting for the space of a day and night. In the mornIng,
taking out the gold, again melt, beat and place it in the fur·
nace as before. Again also, after a day and night, take it
away, andmixing a little copper with it, melt itas before, and
replace it upon the furnace. And when you have taken it
away a third time, wash and dry it carelully, and so weighing
it, see how rnuch is wanting, then lold it up and keep it.
