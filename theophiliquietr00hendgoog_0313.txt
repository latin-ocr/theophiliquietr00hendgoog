Bur if there should be but little gold, which you wish to di-
gest, beat it and lay it together in the pots as before. After·
wards take a new clay pot and break a bole in the bottom,
and four (holes) round the sides, and make u small vase in
clay, with three feet so separated from each other that they
can stand over the opening which is in the bottom of the pot;

place the vessels with the gold upon this when it has become
dry, and you will elevate the pot upon three stones some-
whst apert from each other, and equally thick, and put in
some glowing ceals, theu some dead (coals), and thus as
often as they are deficient superpose fresh, and never suffer
the vessels to be destitute of lire. But sometimes stir the
coals with a small pisce of wood put through the opening,
and the like below, that the ashes may come out and the air
may have access. And act with the coals in the earthen pot
as with the wood in the fornace above.

and rub it until it is made white, and break them together very
finely. Take also a small vase from those in which gold or
silver is melted, which, however, should be thieker than those
for this work, and place it in the fire until it glows; put like·
vvise in the lire ethin and curved iron, fixed into a handle at
one extremity, but at the other having a round knob, and
when both have become glowing, hold the small vase with
the forceps over a basin wide and dry, and pour the quick-
