and again put in sand with water. When from the rotation
and re·rotation the sand has began to bubble and be diffused
over the stone, collect it again always, and replace it in the
lrollow with a small, long, and thin wood, unless by chance .
the gold should be scattered and not milled. But when it is
completely ground it is taken out and washed and dried as
above, and it is placed upon a scale. If, however, any should
be deficient, the dregs which flow from the stone are
washed, and it is thus lound3 for this reason it is that the
stone is placed in the vase. ln this manner also should pure
silver, very thinly beaten, and mixed with quicksilver, be

- milled, because it cannot be milled in the hot vessel with a

heated iron. lt should be so mixed together, however, that
five parts, by weight, may be ol quicksilver, and the sixth be
pure silver.

You can also grind gold lighter in this manner. 'lake a large
vase of clay proved in the lire, and place it in the coals until
it quite glows; and put into it the gold mixed with the quick-
silver and broken up very small, and holding ir with the pin-
cers, move round the hand evenly, and you will soon see how
the gold is liquehed and mixed with the quicksilver. And
when it has become quite liquid, directly pour it into water,
and wash and dry it as above. Beware above all of thiatbat
you do not grind, or gild, fasting, because the exhalation ol
quicksilver is of great danger to a fasting stomach, and it
generatas different infirmities, against which you should use
Zedoar and the berries of the laurel, with pepper and garliok
' and wine. Alter this, weigh this gilding substance in the
balance and divide it in tw0, and the half of it again into
two, and until you obtain single drams, and put them singly
into goosequills, that you may know how much you may lay
on in gilding in every place. Then beat a portion osred
copper into the slrape of a chisel, and fix it to a handle, and
