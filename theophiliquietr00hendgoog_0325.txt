you rub the niello, wetted with saliye, carefully and smoothly
everywhere, until all the drawings are plainly seen, and it is
quite smooth. You also have a piece os wood from the lime
tree, of ,the length and thickness of the smallest finger, dry

and smoothly cut3 upon which you place this wet powder,
which comes from the stone and saliva iu rubbing, and with
this wood and the same powder you rub the niello a long
time, and lightly, and always add saliva, that it may be wet,
until itis made brilliant everywhere. Then take wax from
the hollow of your ear, and when you have wiped the niello
clean with a fine linen eloth, you auoint it everywhere, and
with goat or hart's skin you will lightly rub it until it is made
quite bright.

, the cup of the chalice, the ribs of which you have already
blackened one half, and file and serape those parts which
you have altematively lest without niello, and portray
upon them whatever· work you wish, sc, however, that it
may somewhat differ srom all the uiello work, and with a
slender sculping iron you will carve it very finely. You will
afterwards gild them, and all the vase incide and outside, tbe
niello excepted, and you will polish and colour them like the
handles. Then you cover a round anvil, and you will biud
it round with smooth parchment, over which you place the
cup, which the boy sitting before you can hold with both
hands, adjusting each rib to the auvil evenly, according to
what you may order him. lu the meantime take a fine in-
strument which has a hole at the point, by the blow of which
you produce a very fine circle, and you will fill up all the
grounds in the gilt ribs with it, striking lightly upon it with a
hammer, end joining successively each circle to the other
with punched work. This being accomplished, place the cup

over the coals until these strokcs receive a yellow colour iu·
