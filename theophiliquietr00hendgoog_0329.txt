01³ THE PIPE.

Yon make also the pipe forthe chalice in this manner. Make
an iron in length a palm and four fingers, which at one eud
must be very fine and must continue increasing to the other
extremity, which must be like a straw ; and let the iron be
round and smoothly tiled. And when you have thinned some
pure silver, sold it round this iron, joining the ends smoothly
witha file, and taking off the iron, place it in the lire, aud
solder it. Again placing the iron in it, beat it with the
hammer equally over all until the join is no longer visihlc.
Theo make, by itself, a knob round and hollow, or square and

solid, and make a perforation in it, through which the pipe is
placed from the lower part almost to the top, aud thus, the
iron being taken away, you will again solder everywhere.

And when it has become firm, the iron being put on anew, you
beat everywhere from the knob downwnrds until it is made
smooth end firm 3 and from the knob upwards, namely, in
that part which is vvider and thicker‚ place ou an iron, thiu
and wide, according to the size os the pipe, and beat it with
the hammer upon en auvil, so that the upper opening may be
square and thio, which from the knob upwards should sur-
mount the chalice and be beldin the mouth, but be below
round and slender. Which being done, if yon wish, you can
ornament the knob with niello, and you will gild the rest of
the pipe in the snshion above. Take great care iu this, that
you strongly serape all thick silver which you wish to gild,
whether sor a cup, or plate, or bottle, because in working
it forms a pellicle'outside‚ srom the lire and hammer,
which, is 'not scraped away when it is gilt, when it is coloured
