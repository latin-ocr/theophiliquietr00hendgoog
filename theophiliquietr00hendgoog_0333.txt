Tanau is also a gold called Spanish gold, which is composed
from red copper, powder of basilisc and human blood and
acid. The Gentiles, whose skilsulness in this art is pro·

bable, make basiliscs in this manner. They have, under-
ground,a house walled with stones everywhere, above and
below, with two very small windows, so narrow that scarcely
any light can appear through them; in this house they place
two old cocks of twelve or fifteen years, aud they give them
plenty of food. When these have become sat, through the
heat of their good condition, they agree together and lay
egge. Which being laid tbe cocles are taken out and toads ·

are placed in, vvhich may hatch the egge, aud to which breed
is given for food. 'l'he eggs being hatched‚ chickens issue

out, like hens’ chickenS, to which after seven days grow the
tails of serpente, and immediately, if there were nota stoue
pavement to the house, they would enter the earth. Guard·
ing against which, their masters have round brass vessels of
large size, perforated all over, the mouths of which are narrow,
in which they place these chickens, and close the mouths with
copper coverings and inter them underground, and they are
nourished with the fine earth entering through the holes for
six months. After this they uncover them and apply a co-
pious hre, until the animals inside are completely bumt.
Which done, when they have become cold, they are taken
out and carelirlly ground, adding· to them a third part of the
blood of a red rnen, which blood has been dried and ground.
These two compositione are tempered with sharp aeid in a
clean vessel; they then take very thiu sheets of the purest
red copper, and anoint this composition over them on both
sides, and place them in the lire. And when they have be-
come glowing, they take them out and quench and wash
them in the same confection; and they do this lor a loug time,
until this composition eats through the copper, and it takes
the colour of gold. This gold is proper lor all work.
