run erery'where as if water were poured over it. And irn-
mediately sprinkle it slightly with water, and take it out, and

· you will carefully wash it, and again anoint the solder, and

will solder it as before until all the wires hold firmly.

· Amnnwsnns cut these in pieces like straps, so that every

band may have a wire, which you will bend together, and
make small settings of them, by which the stones may be en·
closed, large and small, to the size of each one, and you will
arrange them in their places. You will also have flour of
wheat ¹or rye, which you will mix with water in a small
cup, and place over the coals, that it may become a little
warm3 in this you dip these settings slightly, one by one,
each in the lower part, and so fix them in their place. All
being made fast, place the piece ol gold upon which you have
fastened them over the coals until the molsture of the flour
is dried, end they will soon adhere. Takc also the fine wire
and beat it slightly upon the auvil, so that it may be rather
thin, and yet that thc beads above and below may not pro·
ject nor lose their form: with them you will weave flowers,
large end small, with which you will fill up all the grounds be-
tween the aetlingc, when you have formed these with the fine
pincers dip thern into the wet flour, and you will thus put each
in its place. Which being done, place it over the coals that
it may become dry, and immediately anoint the soldering and
solder it as above. Both pieces of one handle being soldered
and made firm, join them together, and place a foundation to

thern around them near their inner edge, hemely, a thin piece

ol gold, which may be like a straw, and smooth everywhere.

When you have joined which piece between the two, bend

three mall thin pieces of iron, and make small stays which
