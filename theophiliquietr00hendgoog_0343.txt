can hold the outer pisces of gold in three places outside, so
that the third which compassos the inside near the edge, cannot
be disunited. This being done, anoint the solder everywhere,
and you will dry it a little over the fire, and the coals being
arranged and glowing you make a hollow among thern, in
which you place the handle, and about this you will arrange
the coals in order, so that they may not touch the gold, but rise
arouud it like a wall, until they dominata the gold3 and you
will then place above it two or three slight picces of iron,
which may pass across. Over this you will place the coals
everywhere, and cover it carefully, so however that some
openings may remain among these coele, through which you
can see how the eolder flows. When you sce which instantly
sprinkle it with a little water: you take it out and will gently
wash and dry it, and, carefully considering it, if there is any
fault you correct it, and again anointing it ae before, you will
eolder it, and do this until it is made firm everywhere. ln this
manner you will make the other handle and solder it. Which
being accomplished, join thern both to the cupos the chalice
iu'their places, and make two lines upon the cup itsell with a
graver, by means of which you can see whether they are
placed straight in saldering. Then melt pure gold, and mix
with it a third part of red and pure copper, which likewise,
fused and slightly beaten, you will file altogether and place in
a goose quill. After this accumulate before the furnace a
great heap of coals, and place in them the cup of the chalice,
so that half of it may be altogether under the coele, and that
part upon which a part ol the handle isto be placed may
altogether rise above them3 you immediately join which

Î‡ (handle) on to it, and anoiut the vase with the handle inside

and out with the soldering, aud you will scatter the filings
which you had placed iu the quill insidc aud out with the

' aolder, about the junction by which the handle is united to

the cup, and thus, fire being placed around, you will heap the
ooals in a circle, as you did before about the handle, and
place the irone over it, which you cover plentifully with coals.
ln the front part within the hollow of the cup place the coals
in the ehape of a small furnace, so that the coals may lie
