you may wish to make in enamel‚ whether chelea, or lancta,
or small llowers, or birds, or animale, or figures; and you will
arrange the small pieces delicately and carefully, each inite
place, and will fasten them with moistened flour over the
coals. When you have filled one portion, you will solder it
with the greatest care, that the slender and fine gold may not
be diejoined nor liquefy3 and do thus twice or three times,
until the separate pieces adhere a little

work, and breaking a particle from each piece, place all the
fragments together upon a piece of oopper, each piece by
itsell, and placing it in the lire arrange the ooals around and
abore it, and blowing carefully, you will eea whether they
melt equally; if eo, use thern all; if however any particle is
harder (than the rest) place it by itself. Taking separate
piecea of the proved glaes‚ place them in the lire one by one,
and when each one has become glowing‚ throw it into a
copper veseel in which there is water, and it instantly ilias
into small fragmenta, which you break with a round pestle
until made quite fine, and you will thus waeh it and put it
into a clean ressel, and you cover it with a linen cloth. In
thie manner you prepare the separate colours. Which being
done, take a piece of the aoldered gold, arid you will fasten it
upon a smooth table with wax in two places, and taking a
goose quill cut to a point, as if for writing but with a longer
beak and not split, you take out with· it one of the colours os

replace in ita small cup and cover it, and do this with each
colour until one piece ie filled: taking away the wax, to which
it had adhered,place thie piece upon athin iron, which may have
a short handle, and cover it with another iron which is hollow

like a cup, and let it be perforated linely all over, so that the
holes may be inside flat and wide, and outside finer aad
