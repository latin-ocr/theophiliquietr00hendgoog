and the breadth of a thumb‚ which handle will have a lion's
head at the extremity, cast and properly sculptured, which
head will hold the small basin in his' mouth. It will also
have at the other end a head carved in a similar manner, in
the mouth of which a ring will hang, by means of which it
can be carried, the finger being inserted. The remainder ol
the handle between the two heads should be decorated in
places with niello, and in places be ornamented with molten
and point work and letters of verses in their places. The
small cup, which is at the extremity, should be perforated at
bottom in the centra, of the sine of two fingere in circumfer-
ence, with very fine holca, through which the wine and the
waterto be placed in the chalice should run, by means of
which the sacrament of the Lord's blood is accomplished.

CHAPTER LVlIl.

OF THE VIAL.

Bur if you wish to make the rial for pouring out the wine,
beat the silver in the same manner as the knot ol the foot of
the chalice is beaten, excepting that the body of the vial
should be formed much wider, and its neck be narrowed upon
a long and slender auvil with the moderate-sized horned and
iron hammer, Sometimes also the vial, when its formation
has commenced, may be filled with wax, and be lightly struck
with the middling iron hammer, that the roundness of the
body and the shape of the neck may be more properly and '
evenly trimmed. And thus, the wax being taken out, it may
again be re=heated upon the coals, and the wax again be put
in, and it may be beaten as before until it ie altogether formed.
Which being done, if yon wish to make upon the rial figures,
or animals, or flowers in beaten work, first composa the mix·
ture of pitch and wax and tile.
