CHAPTER LX.

OF THE BEATEN CENSER.

lr however you should wish to make a censer in beaten work,
in gold, silver, or brass, you will first purify it in the above
order, end you pour into the iron moulds, two, or three, or
four marks, according to the quantity which you wish the
upper portion of the censer to possess. You will then thin it
in a circle in the seme way as the larger silver chalice above
mentioned, excepting, that this work is thicker and is to be

depressed deeper inside, that it may be higher outside, so that
its height may possess the whole of its breadth and one hali
of it When you have lengthened out its height, before yon
limit the breadth, portray towers in it, hemely, on the top,
one octengular, in which the same number of windows are
made, under which four square towers are made, upon every
one of which three columns are placed, and between them
two lengthened windows, in the midst of which, over the
middle column, e small round window is made: under these,
in the third place, eight other towers ere mede3 nemely, four
round, against the upper equares, in which are made small
flowers, or birds, or animale, or smell windows, and between
these four square (towers) which may be yet broader, in
which the half figures of angele are mede, ss if resting in
them with their wings. Under which, in the rounding itself
of the rese, four arches are made, s little drawn out at the
top, in which are made the evangeliste, whether in likeness
of angela, or in figures of animels; between these archeS,
upon the edge of the rounding, four heads of lions are placed,
or of men, cast, through which the chains may pass. These
things thus portreyed, they are struck out with the ductile
and hammering irons, inside and outside, until they are
altogether sheped, and ere thus filed and rasped and chased ·
with the sculping instrumente. This is the upper pert of the
censer. Then the lower part with its foot is struck out, in
which four arches are made which may correspond to those
above, in which may rest the sour rivers of Peradise, in humen
