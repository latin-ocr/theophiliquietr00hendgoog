and another upper (mass) which will be wider; these lumps
are called the “ nuclei.'' You will directly pierce these with
a piece of wood cut lengthwise, smoothly upon the four

an iron through thern, which is called the turning iron, long and ⁴
rather slender, which is thicker at one end, smoothly beaten
on the four sides, and diminishing more and more elenderly
towards the point ; in the thicker part of this another iron
