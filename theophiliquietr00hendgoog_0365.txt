you write in the lower border of the same space, and in each
angle, next the stenes, you make small windows. This will be
a liheness of which the prophet says: “On the East three
gates; on the North three gates; on the South three gates;
and on the West three gates.’' ln the four angles which are
between the divisione of the doors, you will form single round
turrets, through which the chains will pass. These things
thus disposed, you make on the topos the upper tower, in the
square spaces, single entire figures of angels, (with their
shields and lances as if standing on guard upon the walls, and
in the round turrate you will fashion small columns with their
capituls and bases. In the same manner you make in the last
tower but one, which is shorter‚ half images of angela, and in
the same way of columns. And in the upper tower, which
will be more sleuder, you make long and rounded windows,
and on the top of the towers hulwarlts around3 in the middle
of these you will fashion a lamb, and upon its head acrown
aud eroes, and about its back a small arch, in the top of which
a ring must be, to which the middle chain is fixed. This is
the upper partos the censer with its work.

ln the lower part, similarly covered with wax, you will form
iu each space single ligures of the prophete with their writ-
ings, and will adapt to each apostle a corresponding prophet,
that their testimonias, which are inscribed upon the scrolls,
may agree with each other¹.) But you malceno doors around
the prophete, but only let the spaces be quadrangular and
their names be written upon the borders over their heads.
You also make in the angles four towers, in which the chains
are fixed that they may be fitted with those higher up. ln
the lower round space you make as many circles as you can
or wish, in which you form single feminine half figures of the
virtues, the names of which you write in the circles. At the
last also you will fashion and turn the foot, and all the spaces

about the figures above and below will be transpierced. .
Thon, the tunnels and air holes being placed in every part,
you plaster thin clay carefully about it, and will dry it in the
sun, and you do this again, and a third time 3 these parts are
