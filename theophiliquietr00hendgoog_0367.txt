now called moulds. You place these, perfectly dry, at the
lire, and when they have become warm, pour out the melted
wax into water, and you again place them at the fire, aud you
do thus until you have removed all the wax. After this you
lay lorge and cold coals ina lit and smooth place, upon which
you establish the moulds with the openings turned down-
wards, and you place around them some hard stones which
cannot fly to pieces by the heat of the lire, and you will
anauga them stone upon stone like a wall, dry without mor·-
tar, so that between the stones many small openings may re-
main. These being thus arranged, higher by half a foot than
arethe moulds, spread around the hot coals, and then the
cold, unto the top, and take care that such space be between
the moulds and the stones as may contain the coals. When
all the coals are glowing, they are sometimes to be stirred
with a thin wood on every side through the openings between
the stenes, that they may be closed together, and the heat be
equal everywhere. And when they have deseended so much
that you can see the moulds, again fill up to the top with oold
coals, and do thus a third time. And when you see the
moulds glow outside, place the vessel in the fire with the
brass which you wish to cast, and you will hlow slightly at
first, then more and more until it be quite liquefied. This being
done, oarefully stir it with un instrument bent and fixed in
wood, and turn it into another wide (vessel), again fill it with
brass and heat it, and do thus until the vessel be filled, and
you will again stir it with tha curved instrument and will
purge it from coals, and blowing strongly with the bellows
you will cover it with large coals. 'lhe stenes being then
removed, you take the moulds from the lire and carefully
plaster clay, plentifully sprinkled with water and thinned like
lees, with a eloth, and so a trough being made near the fur·
nace in which you found, you place in the moulds and heap
up earth on every side and carefully compress it with a piece
of wood flat at the bottom, by frequently pounding it. And
directly hove readya small eloth many times folded and
placed in a picco of split wood, and the vessel being taken
from the lire with the pincers curved at the end, and the
small eloth being applied which can defend it from dust and
