may wish, to the proportion of each large or small censer.
And when you have bent all the chains ol one censer in one

holes in it with a pointed iron instrument, round and hot;
through these holes you draw the chain, cooked in the fire
and again eooled, and you again cook it; again you draw it
through another hole and re-cook it, and you act thus until it
is equally thick and round. 'l'hen eut this chain into pieces,
