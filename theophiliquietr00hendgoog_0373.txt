until it is sufficient for the siae of the furnace. And when the
stone bas commenced to liquety, the lead flows out through
some small cavities, and the copper remeius within. When
tbis has been blown upon for a very long time, and cooled, it
is taken out and other is again placed in aster the seme order.
To this copper thus melted a fifth part of tin is added, and a

' rnetal is made with which bells are founded.

Akind of stone is also found os a yellowish colour, and
sometimes red, which is called calamina, which is not broken
up, (¹ but as it is dug up it is placed upon wood, heaped up
and very glowing, and is burued until it quite glows This
stone, afterwards cooled and broken very small) is mixed with
coals finely divided, and is mingled with the above-mentioned
copper in the sumace, which is composed in this manner.

CHAPTER LXIV.

OF THE FURNAGE.

Foun stones, in the fashion os a crosa, stand, separated
from each other the length of a foot, partly fixed in the
earth, but rising equally to the height of a foot above the
ground, and all equal at the upper part. Upon these stones
four square irone are placed, of the thickness ola finger, and
of a length that they can be laid across from one stone to
another. Between these, other intervening irons are placed
of tbe same size, at an equal distance, that is, separated frorn
each other by a breadth of four fingere: upon these also
others, equal in form end measure to those below, are placed
across, so that the openings may appear to bc square. These
being thus separated, clay, strongly beaten and mixed with
horse dung, is placed upon the same irons, to the thickness
of three fingens, so that it may adbere to these irone and
stones everywhere, and appear as if a round heartb lay upon
the stones. Then with a round wood openings are made in
