CHAPTER LXVII.

ΟΡ THE Punlvlcnvlolv 01² COPPER.

Taua an iron dish of the size you wish, and line it in-
'side and out with clay strongly beaten aud mixed, auditis

carehrlly dried. Thea place it before a lorge upon the coele,
so that when the bellovrs act upon it the wind may issue
partly within and partly above it, and not below it. And
very small coals being placed round it, place the copper init
equally, and add over it a heap of ceals. When, by blowing
along time, this has become melled, uncover it and east im-
mediately line ashes ol coals over it, and stit it with a thin
and dry piece of wood ae if mining it, and you will directly
see the burnt lead adhere to these ashes like a glue. Which
being cast out again superpose coals, and blowing for a long
time, as at first, again uncover it, and then do as you did be-
fore. You do thie until at length by cooking it you can
withdraw the lead entirely. Then pour it over the mould
which you have prepared for this, aud you will thus prore il it
be pure. Hold it with the pincers, glowing as itis, before it has
beconm cold, and atrike it with a large hammer strongly over
the auvil, and if it be broken or split, you must liquefy it
auew as before. ll, however, it should remain sound, you
will oool it in water, and you cook other (copper) in the same
manner. This copper is called burnt. From this copper
you can work whatever you may wish to make, for gilding, in
ductile work, in ligures and animale and birds, in censere and
different vases, in borders of tablets, in wires and chains.
Make auricalcum from this eopper with the addition of cala-
mine, in the same manner as you have composed the brass'of
caldrons above. When you have recooked this four or five
limes in small vessels placed in the l'urnaee, whatever you

have cast from iv in a variety of divers work, you can gild
in the best manner.
