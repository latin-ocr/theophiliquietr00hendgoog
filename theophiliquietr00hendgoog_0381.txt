CHAPTER LXVIII.

now FINE BRASS CAN BE GIL'I'.

Do you therefore wish to gild a censer, of fine brass, do
in the same manner as above, when you gilded the handles
of the silver chelice, but with greater care, because siIver
and simple copper can be more easily gilt than auricalcum.
It should also be more warily and carefully revived‚ and more
thickly gill, also more frequently washed and longer dried.

When it has begun to show a yellow colour‚ if you see white
spots spread all over it, which will not become equally dry,
this is the effect of the calamina, which was not well purged
and cooked¹, which you will thus remedy. Take soap and
place it in a small clean cup and pour water upon it, and with
your fingere, as if in washing, mix it carefully until it hus
become like the lees of beer, and with hog's brislles anoint ir
smoothly every where over the gilt censer. Thea place it
upon the coals and heat it until this mixture begins to blacken,
and so raising it with the pincers, sprinkle it with water every
where, and thus you will wash it, and you polish it with brass
wires as· before mentioned. Which being done, you will
again rub it around with the wine-stone and quIclrsilver, and
will gild it anew, on account of tha heat of the coals which
are more osten placed in it, unless by hazard, if it were thiuly
gilt, the gold itself may be bumt, and again you polish it
with the wires, and place it anew upon the coals, warming it
for a longer time, until it shows a red colour‚ and you will
immediately cool it in water, and polish it with smooth instru-
menta proper for this work, and will colour it with atrament,
burnt, as we have before said.
