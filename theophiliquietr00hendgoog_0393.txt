cun beat aud thin it with a long and slender hammer, if neod-
ful. But il two or three, or more, heads should be in the
picture, you should do about each one as l have said, until
the height which you may wish is attained. Then with
the tracing instrument design the body or bodies of the

figures, and so, by depressing and sometimes by beating, you
will relieve them as much as it may plesse you3 providing
this, however, that the head be always the most relieved.
Alter these things you will design the nostrils and eyebrows,
the mouth aud ears, the hair, eyes, hands and arms, and the
other shadews ol the draperies, the footstools and feet, and
you will raise them inside thus, with the smallest curved in·
struments, above all taking care that it be not broken or per·
forated. But if through want of knowledge, or negligence,
this should huppen, it should be soldered iu this manner.
Tulle a little of the gold itsell, or silver, and mix with it a third
partos copper, and meltiug them together yon will lile it
finely, and wine-stone being bumt and salt added, you will
mix it with water3 thinly auointing it with which, spread
'the liling over the fracture. This dry, again anoint the mix·
ture, more thiekly, and coals being applied above and below,
you will blow gently, until you can see the solder flow. See·
ing which, immediately sprinkle it with water, and if it be
hard, well; if not, however, do the like again until it has be-
come firm. Should the fracture, however, be broad, carefully
join a small piene of the same gold or silver, equally thin, to
it, which you will solder in the like manner until it adhere
everywhere. And when the relief of tlle ligures shall have
beon carried to the point of the chasings, should it be gold,
you immediately make them, and polish curesully, and you
will colonr it with “ atrament,”¹ bumt to redness, and salt,
as above in the work of the chaliee Should, however, the
picture be silver, aud you should wish upon these figures to
gild the crowns, the hair, heard and portione of the draperies,
this should be done before the fine lines are made, in this
manner. Anange two parts only of clay, finely ground, end
a third of salt, and mix thern ¹together in a small vessel with
