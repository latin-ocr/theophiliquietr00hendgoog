silver platee tirlly relieved and polished, take wax and melt it
in an earthenware or copper vessel, end mix tile, finely ground,

outside part with awoollen cloth and saud, until the black
coat be taken off, and so be gilt and polished, and the drawa

ings being finished, be coloured and filled with the above
mentioned composition.
