borders slender and wide, in which can be flowers, animala
and small birds, or dragous linked together by the necks and
tails, and they are not sculptured too deeply, but moderately
and earefully. You will than thin silver, much more thinly
than lor the relies, of the length you wish‚ and you will
cleanse it with charcoal, finely pulverized, and a cloth; you
polish it with chalk scraped upon it. '
Which being done, affirr the silver to any border, and the
iron being placed upon an anril, so that the engraving may
be uppermost, and the silver lying upon it, place above it
some thick lead and atrike strongly with the hammer, so that
the lead may beat upon the thiu siber, into the sculpture, so
strongly, that all the designa may fully appear in it. But
should tha plote be longer (than the stamp) draw it from place
to place, and, affixed to the iron, hold it evenly with tha pin-
cera, and one part being struck, another can be hammered,
and do thus until all the plate be filled up. This kind of
work is rather useful, about the borders, in manufacturing
the tablea of altars, in pulpits, in caskets for sacred sub-
stances, and in whatever places needful 3 and when the relies
is beautiful and delicate, it is easily done. Work of this kind
is also made in copper, which is thinned in a similar manner,
is cleansed and gilt and polished ; this placed upon the iron,
so that the gilding be turned towards the iron, the lead being
superposcd, it is struck until the designa appear. The image
ol the crucifixion of the Lord is also sculptured in iron, in the
above mentioned manner, of which, when impressed upon
silver or copper, phylacteria are made, that is, coffera of relies
and small shrines of saints. A sculpture is also made in iron
of the image of the Lamb of God, and the figures of the four
evangelista, with which, impressed upon gold or silver, the
cupa of precious wood are ornamented, the circle of the lamb
standing in the middle ol the cup, the four evangelista in
fashion of a eross around, and with four borders proceeding

from the lamb to the four evangelists; ligures of small lish
andos birds and beasts are made, which are fixed upon the
remaining ground of the cup, affording much ornament.
The image ol the Divinity is also made in the same manner,
