pared gold of the weight of a nummus is then beaten to the

same hreadth and length, and these two are united together ἱ

with the prescrihed gold solder, until they persectly adhere to
each other, end they are thus beaten together until every line
plateis made. This work appears as if the silver were gilt
on one side; nor can aleas of such length be so brilliantly
gilt with two or three nummi of gold. From this leel borders
are made, from the iron stamp, in the before-mentioned
manner. Fine strips are also cut from it and are wreathed
round in spnn silk; gold fringes are made from it for the
poor in the same manner as from pure gold for the rich.

may wish. Then beat the cavity in the place of the head with
a moderate round hammer on the under side, and around it, on
the upper side, with the slender hammer, and so you coolr it in
the emhers. This being· cooled hy itself, you will do through·

copper with the curved and smooth irons, hy always depressing .
iton each side and frequently reheating it. And when you
shall hare reliered the ligure aa high as you wish, take irons,
long to the measure of a palm, thicker at one end, upon which
it may be beaten with the hammer, and at the other more line,
round, and pointed, which yon had prepared for this work,
and the boy initiated in this art sitting before you, hold the
plate in the lest hand and the irone in the right, the hoy
striking upon thern with a moderate sized hammer, yon will
design the eyes and nostrils, the hair and fingere of the hands,
the artierrlations of the feet, and all the drawings of the gar-
