and chin and ears, end you will design the hair and all the fine
drawing of the draperies, and tlie nails of the hands and feet.
Which being done, ir you wish to decorate the crowns of the
figures with gerne, enamel‚ and pearls‚ immediately work
single pieccs in gold with wires and solder, as above in the
work of the chalice, and fitting each one in its place, make
holes through which they should be fasteued on, namely,
under the larger geme, and equally in the copper; and you
will thus gild the plate, and you polish it at first with the
bross vires, as above, then with the smooth irons; and thus
you will colour it, and you fix on the pieces of gold, each one
in its place, and you lay on the garns, and you will fasten the
pearls around. ln the same manner should you possess la-
cility of invention, you can make figures in gold antl silvei
upon the books of the evangelista and missals, and animals
and small birds and llowers outside upon the horse-saddles os
matrone. Upon golden or silver cups or plattera, in the
middle, knights are made in the same manner, fighting
against lions or griffins3 the figure of Sampson, or David
breaking the months of the lions; lions alone, also, and grif-
fins3 the same also, each strangling single (figures ol) cattle3
or other thing which it may please you, aud which may be
proper and fit, according to the aize of the work.
