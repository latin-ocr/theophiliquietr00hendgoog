it can be placed in another curved iron, by which it is en·
compassed, aller the fashion ol the wood in which the auger
is revolved, aud at the other extremity let it be slender, ac-
cording to the size of the lower end ol the pipe which should
be placed on the bellows. Then pure and very sound copper
is thinned, so that the impression of the nail may appear on
the other side. When this has been marked out and cut
according to the siae of the iron for the longer pipes, which
are called grave, an opening is made according to the precept
of the lesson, into which the valve should be placed, audit
is rasped round a little to the size of the rod ¹, and tin is
anointed over it with the soldering iron, and it is rasped upon
one edge of the length inside‚ and outside, upon the other
edge, and it is tinned over thinly. Which tinnings, before
the newly made lines are scraped, are slightly anointed, the
copper being warmed with resin of the fir, that thetin may
the more easily adhere. Which being done this copper is
folded around the iron and is strongly bound round 'with an
iron wire moderately thick, so that the tinned lines may
agree with each other. This wire should be first carried
through a very small hole which is at the thin extremity of
the iron, and be twisted twice round init, and so be carried
down revolving to the other extremity, and hethere similarly
fastened. Then with its joinings agreeing together and care-
fully sastened, it is placed with its ligature, as with the iron,
before the furnace upon the glowing embers, and the boy
sitting and slightly blowing, in the left hand is held a thin
w00d‚ at the split top of which a small cloth with resin is
lixed, and in the right can be held a long piece of tin beaten
thin, so that directly the pipe has become hot he can anoint
the join with the rag filled with resin, and the tiu applied
may liquefy, and he must caresully solder the join together.
Which being done, the pipe cold, ,the ironis placed in the
instrument prepared like that of a turner, and the curved
iron being placed on, and wire loosened, one (hand) can re·
volve the curved iron, the other, both hands being provided
with gloves, can hold the pipe firmly, so that the iron may
