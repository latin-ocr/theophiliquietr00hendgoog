be carried round and the pipe remain still, until it appear
elegant to the eyes, as if turned. The iron being then
taken out, the pipe is struck slightly with the hammer near
the opening, above and below, so that this round shape may
depress almost to the centra for a space of two fingers ; the
valve may be made from copper somewhat thicker, like a
half wbeel, and be soldered over about the round part, ns
the pipe above, and be so placed in the lower part of the
opening that its edge rnay stand equally under it, nor pro-
trude below or above. He can have also a soldering iron of
the same breadth and roundness as is the valve. With this,
heated, he can place small particlcs of tin upon the valve,
and a little resin, and can carefully pass over the hot iron
that he may not move the valve, but that the tin being melted
it may so adhcre that no wind can come out in its circum-
ference, unless only into the upper opening. Which being done
he can bring it to his mouth and blow at first slightly, then
more, and then strongly; and according to what he discerne
by hearing, he can arrange the sonno, so thetis he wish it
strong, the opening is mede wider; if slighter, however, it is
made narrower. In this order all the pipes are made; be can
make the measure ol each, lrom the valve upwards, according
to the rule inculcatcd, but from the valve below, all will be of
one measure and of the same thickness ¹.
