the thicker wood a square hole must be made in the centre,
four fingere in breadth, and about which, borders must be left
of the same wood of one finger in breadth and height, in
which the bellows can be placed. ln the upper part of the
side, however, small hollows are made, through which the
wind can arrivs at the pipes. But the other partos the
wood, which should also be uppermost, is measured out in-
side equally, where seven or eight small openings are dis-
posed, in which the stops are carefully joined, so that they
may have an easy means ol being drawn out or restored, so
however, that no air can corne out between the joins.

ln the upper part, however, cut small openings opposite
the lower ones, which moy he rather wider, in which may he
joined so many pisces of wood, so that between these and
the larger, the openings of the wood may renrain empty
through which the wind can mount to the pipes 3 for in these
same pieces ol wood openings should be made in which the -
pipes are to be mede lest. The openings in which the stopa
are fitted in the front port should increase, like slanting win-
dows, through which these stops are introduced and removed.

In the hinder part, under the end of these stops, holes arc
made equally wide and longos the size ot'tvvo fingere, through
which the wind can ascend from the lower to the upper ports,
so that when the stops are pressed upon them these holos
may be stopped by themÍ¾ when, however, they ere withdrawn
they may again lie open. ln those pieces ol wood which are
joined upon the stops openings are made, caresully and in
order, according to the number ol the pipes ol every tone,
in which these pipes are placed, so that they may stand firmly
and receive the wind from the lower parts. But iu the handles
of the stops letters are marked, according to the rise end fall
os the sound, by which it cau be known which tone it may
be. In each one ol tire stops single sleuder bolcs are made,
half os the little linger in length, in the front port, near the
handles, lengthwise, in which single copper headed nsils may
bc placed, which may pass through the small windows in the
middle, by means of which these stops are drawn from the

upper side of the construction down to the lower, and the
