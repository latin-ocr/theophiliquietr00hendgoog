OF THE BELLows.

In making the wind-chamber, join together two pieces of wood
of the plane trec, in the above mode, of oue t'oot in length, one
ol thch may be a palm thick, the other three lingere, and let
them be round at one end, like a shield, aud there a foot and
a half wide, at the other end blunt, a palm in breedth. When
these have been carefully fitted together, cut, in the round
front in the thicker wood, the openings thch you wish, ac·
cording to the number of the bellows, and in the blunt end
one, which must be largcr. Then cut, from each opening, a
hollow leading to the larger opening, through which the wiod
may have way to the working bellows; and you will thus
glue these woods together with the choeac-gloc, aud yon will
bind them round with a linen cloth, new and strong, which
you auoIntwith the same casein glue that it ruay adhere: you
also make strong iron bindings tinned over withIn and with-
out, thar they may not become disunitcd from the woodwork,
these you will fix on with long nails, headed and tinned, so
that between two openings a binding may exist, which may
include each wood from the upper to the lower side. Thon

length of one foot, in the other of two, which you will piercc
in each end with a large auger, with which the middle por-

openinge cannot meet together, cn account of the curve, make
