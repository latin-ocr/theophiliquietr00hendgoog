Drsrosa the length and width of the case according to the
number of the pipes, and make a mould in beaten clay, and
being dry cut it to whatever size you may wish, and cover it
with wax carefully thinned, between two rods equally thick,

with the round wood. Then cut the openings of the stops in
this wax, and the hole below through which the wind can
enter ; the air-holes with the funnel being added, cover alto·
gether with the same clay, and again, and a third time. And
when the mould has become dry, cast in the same manner
as the form ol the censer abovenrentioned. You will also
sashion the bellowe in clay, the wind-issues proceeding every-
where below in the similitude of the roots ot* a tree, and meet-
ing at the top in one opening. Which, when disposed in
rule you hare cut with a knife, cover with wax and act as
above. And when you have cast the case, you juin, inside‚
at the height ol* one linger from the bottom, a beaten coppar
plate, in an even manner under the openings of the stopa, that
these stops may rest upon it, so that they can be smoothly
drawn forth and returned; and lining these stopa with thin
clay, you pour over the rest of the case some melted lead
everywhere, over these stopa up to the top. This being done,
you cast out this lead and will caresully mark the openings oi
the pipes in the stops; then you will most carefully perforate
in this lead with a thin iron or with a bore. Then you make
the issues lor the wind under the stops; you introduce these
’ stopa singly in their· places, and you replace the lead and you
