that no wind can issue, unless through the openiugs in
which the pipes are placed. When the wind-case hasbeen
cast and fited, and the pipe of each air-issue fitted to its
conductor, it should be joined together and firmly soldered
below to the organ construction, so that the wind may find
its accesa freely, and can in nowise issue through the other
joints. This also is to be carefully provided, that a thin pisce
of copper may hang down before the opening of its pipe,
which can close the access of the air-hole, so that'when by
the breathing of the bellows this copper is displaced, it may
rise, and the wind may freely issue; and when the bellows is
raised, so that it may recover air through its own ventilator,
this copper can quite close its mouth and not permit the
wind which it emitted to return. Ι

ln making a bell, first cut a dry piece of wood, as long as you
wish to have the bell, so that on every side it may protmde
beyond the shape to the length of one palm, and let it be
square at one larger end, at the other more pointed and round,
so that it can be revolved in a hole. And let it be drawn out
larger and larger, so that, when the work bas been finished,
it can easily be taken out. This wood must be cut around
in the thicker part, one palm before the end, thata hollow
may be made two fingere wide, and let the wood hethere
round ; near this furrow the extremity of the wood is made
thiu, that it may be joined in another curved wood, by which
it ia able to be revolved like a latha. Two planks are also
made, equal in length and width, which are joined together
and made firm with four pieces of wood, so that they may be
wide between each other according to the length of the afore·

said wood; a hole should be made in one plank in which the
