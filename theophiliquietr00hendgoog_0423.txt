· rouuded top con be turned, and in the other alike, opposite,

an incision must be made two fingere deep, in which tha κ ,ί
round cutting cun be revolved. Which being done take the = *J ὼ·
block itself and apply strongly beaten clay round it, first os all ‘'1'4', ⁸*

two fingere thick, which being carefully dry, apply another
upon lt, and you do thus until the mould be supplied as you
may wish to have it, and beware that you neverat any time
superpose clay upon other (clay), unless that below has become
perfectly dry. Then set this mould between the before-men-
tioned planks, and, the boy who can revolve it being seated, you
will turn it as you may wish, and holding a eloth moistencd
in water you will smooth it.

Alter this, taking tallow, cut it up very finely and macerate .„ u · -· ·

it with the hands, and two even pieces of wood being fixed
together of the thickness you may wish, you will thin out
the tallow placed between them upon an even board, with
the wooden roller, as the wax above, water being placed
under that it may not adhere, and so you will immediately lift
it suddenly, and will lay it upon the mould and will fasten
it round with ahot irou. Agaim thinning apiece ol grease,
in the same manner, you will fasten it next to the first,
and do thus until you cover the mould. ¹You make the
rim of the bell ol the thickness you please. You will
turn the grauso, when quite cold, with sharp instrumente,

and should you wish any ornament about the sides of the Ἰ

bell, of flowers, or letters, you will hollow them out in the
tallow‚ and will lashion four openings near the neck, that it
may sound better. You then superpose clay, sifted and care-

fully mixed, which being dry you add other above it. That t„

again being quite dry, you turn the mould upon its side and
remove the wood by striking gently, and the mould being
again raised you will llll the opening· above with solt clay,
and you impress the curved iron, in which the clapper
should hang in the middle, so that its extremities may project
outside. And when the clay has become dry, make it even
with the rest of mould and cover it with tellow, so that the
ends ol the iron may adhere well in ir. After these things
form the neck, aud thc bundles, and the air-holo, or sunuel,
