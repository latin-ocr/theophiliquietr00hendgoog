utterly withdrawn, close both openings with beaten clay, to
the proper measure, so that the rim of the bell may not be in-
jured, and supply wood more abundantly about the mould, that
sor the whole day and the following night the fire may not
be wanting. ln the mean time take an iron pot, round at the
bottonr, fit only sor this work, which must have on each side
two iron handles, or should the bell be large, two or three
(pots) and you anoint them inside and out with clay beaten
strongly, once and again and a third time, until it be two
fingens thick, and stand thern on either side opposite each
other, so that there nray be way between them, and place
sinrple earth under them, and fix thern round with wooden
stakeS, in tw0, or if necessary, three places ; where the bel·
lows should be applied you fix, strongly, two stakes equally
wide, and between them you make an opening against the
rnouth ol the pot, so that the wind can come into it, and in
separate holes you insert separate ironS, thiu and bent, so
that the pipes of the bellows may be able to lie in them firmly3
and thus you make over this pot, with stones and clay, a fur-
nace around it, a foot and a half high, and you line it inside
smoothly, with the same clay, and so apply ignited coals.
And when you have done alike to the separate pots, set the
bellows with their instrumenta in which they may lie firmly,
two to each opening, and to each bellows you will deputa two
strong men. When, however, the inside of the pot has be·
come quite glowing, cut, to each oue, two blocks of oak, dry
and thick, so fit that they may be able to fill the bottom of
the pot inside, and make an opening in the middle of thern
through which one might pour in, and upon these place two
other picces of wood of the same size, and around places
kind of stakeS, from the same wood, protruding from these
’ blocks above the mouth ol the furnace. This being done,
you will weigh all the bross-work which you have, or four
parts may be of copper and a filth of tin, and you appoint to
each pot its proportions, according to its capacity. Theu
going to the nrould furnace, raise the covering above and see
how it may act. lf it should quite glow inside, run back to
the pots, and, lirst of all, put iu sorne large coals. Then lay
