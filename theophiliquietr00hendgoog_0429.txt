in the copper‚ in order without the tin, and intermingle coals,
casting them abundantly above it, and ignited coals being
cast in, cause the bellows to commence blowing, at first
moderately, then more and more. And when you see agreen
fleme ascend, now the copper begins to meh, and immedi-
ately superposing coals plentil'ully‚ run back to the mould
samace, and with the long tougs begin to pluck out the
stanes, and to throw thern away. This work does not de-
mand in this place slothful, but agile and diligent workmen,
lest through neglect of any kind either the mould be broken,
or one may hindcr or hurt the other, or provoke him to anger,
which is above all to be guarded against. The stanes and fire
being ejected, the earth must be again hastily replaced, that
the hollow about the mould may be again carelirlly filled up;
and there may be those who are always passing round with
blunted pieces of wood, beating moderately and trampling
firmly with the feet, that the earth which is placed in may
prees upon the mould‚ lest when the weight of the brass is
poured in, it in any way be broken. The hollow being then
m this manner filled up to the top, return quickly to the pots,

into the handles ol the pot, and active men being called, skillul
in this art, cause it to be raised with every care and carried to
the mould‚ and the coals and—ashes being thrown out aad the
strainer eloth put on, cause it to be poured in hardily. ln the
meantime lie down, near the mouth of the mould‚ caresully
remarkiug, by listening, how lar within it may proceed 3 and
should you perceive as il a slight murmur of thunder, de-
sire that they hold a little, and then again that they
pour in; and so that sometimes by holding and again by
pouring, the brass be made to subslde evenly, until that
pot be empty. Which being removed, another brought into
the same place must be set up directly, the same is done with
this as with the former, and in like manner with a third until
the brass is seen in the sunuel. Nor may the pot be imme-
