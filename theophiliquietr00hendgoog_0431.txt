diately removed, but kept for a space, that, should the brass
8181, 11 may again be poured over. But should you wish
to withdraw from this fatigue 81 carrying and founding in
parts, procura for yourself a very large pot, which must be
flat at the bottom, and make an opening in 1188 the side at
the bellom, and cover it with clay inside and without, as
above. This being done, station it near the mould, not
further than 8 distance 81 five 1881, and fasten it round with
stokes, and lay in fire with coals. And when it has become
glowing close the opening, which will be towards the rnould,
with clay, and arrange upon it four pieces os wood, and make
the small stakes inside the furnace, us above. Then, the
copper being placed in with 88818 and lire, and three ranges
81 bellows being applied, cause them to be maufully blown.
ln the mean time you have 8 dry piece 81 wood 81 such length
that 11 888 resch from the opening in the pot to the mouth 81
the mould, the bend of this must be ample. When you shall
have covered this everywhere with clay and especially above,
inter it that it may be even with the ground, but rather higher
near the pot, and heap ignited coals upon it. Thetin being
placed in and stirred with the copper, as above with the
curved iron which is strongly lixed upon wood, open the hole,
and with the 8881818818, who can hold two straining clotbs, al-
low them to flow out; sometimes withholding, however, 88
above. And when the mould has become full should any
brass remain in the pot, place 8 mass' 81 clay upon the eud 81

you may close it. In both these manners 8188 smaller belle
can be founded, according to the quantity the pots can nrake.
When the brass shall have beconre hard in the 188881, 88888
the earth to be hastily cast out of the hollow and the ground
outside to become somewhat cold. The earth being throwu
out, this mould must be inclined on one sideand be laid upon
the ground, and this is done until, in the same manner 88 11
was placed in, it is taken out 81 the hollow. This being ac-
complished, it is laid down entirely upon one side, and with
hatchets and other sharp instrumenta which are fixed upon
long pisces 81 wood, the inside clay is hastily cast out, be·
