cause, should it be permitted to become cold iu it, it would

be swelled out from the damp of the earth, and, without ,

doubt the bell would be cracked. This being taken out, the
mould must again be raised upon the ground and may so re-
main, until the outside has become quite cold ; and so the
clay may be broken aud the hoops taken away, and what-
ever inequality should be outside, may be cut off with sharp
hammers. Then, in the middle of the bell a block is placed,
similar· to that in which the mould was first turned, and four
other pisces of wood are fastened firmly to its edge‚ so that
the funnel may lie upon one post and this wood upon another,
that, a curved wood being placed on, the bell can be turned,
and with a aandstone be made smooth everywhere. Aller-
wards, the fuunel, liled on every side, is carefully broken, and
about the neck two pieces of wood ere joined together, the
lower, smaller one, through the middle, and the upper, larger,
around it; which pieces of wood must be bound fast by two
hoops, strongly, and are tied by ivon chains about the
handles everywhere. This larger wood should be rather
longer than the bell is wide, and be somewhat tbiuuer at the
ends than in themiddle,and at these ends it must have twotbick
and round irone, the length of which, within tbe wood, may
be a space of half a foot, and beyond it, of one palm. And
when you have fitted two beams for sustaining the bell, make
two messores in them two lingere deep, in which these large
nails can be enclosed, under which you also place two curved
irons for preserving the beams. That larger wood in which
the bell hange must also have, on each side, single holes, in
which two woodo projecting upwards are plaoed; to these the
ropes are tied for tolling. A thick leather als0, of the stag's
neck may be placed round that curved iron, which rests in-
side in the middle of the bell, in which the tongue must
hang, which must be of such length that it may protrude be·
yond the bell lor a space of the widtb of the hand, and let it
be thicker at the end for the length ol a palm, and thinner
,upwards
