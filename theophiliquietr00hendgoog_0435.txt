01² THE MEASURE OF GYMBALS.

Wnonvnn wishes to make cymbals of proper sound for sing-
ing, should divide the wax lor each one with a weigbt, and
should begin from the highest, that by descending he may be
able to arrivs at the graver (cymhals). He ean lilrewise note
each one with its own letter, that he may know it in the par·
tition. In the first place let him make two portione of wax
equol with the balance, one for letter a, the other lor o. Let
him divide the wax ol letter a into eight equal parts, and
(give) so much to the wax of letter o as is in the eighth port
ol wax a: let him similarly divide wax o by eight, and give
so much to letter r as is in its total, and an eighth of its part
beyond, and he will hove two consecutive notes. ln thot
place the semitono should be, und let him thus find it. Let
him divide the whole of the wax of letter a into three parts,
and give this total to letter n end beyond, the third part of it.
Tben let him give so much wax to letter n as is in the total a,
ond the eighth part of it. Likewise let him give as much
wax to letter o as u possessos ond halfe port os it, and he will
thus have two notes aster the semitono. 'l'ben let him afford
to letter s so much wax ss is in the whole amount of letter r
ond beyond, the third part ol it, and be will have the semi-
tone agaim and let him lind the seven concorde from letter
a to n. The octove he cannot yet bave without the eighth
cymbal. Let him therefore double all the wari of lettera,
and so give it to letter A, and nothing will be wanting: the
fourth, eighth and fifth cbord let him find thus, let him take
the amount of the wax of the letter and give so much to
letter r and the half of it beyond, and let him establisb it
between A and n. He who should lesbion or lound the
cymbals should above all take cere, that he puts none of
the above mentioned wax, which is so cautiously weighed
and divided, to the necks end uir-holes, but let him make
nll these from other wax. bethim bove the great sore·
