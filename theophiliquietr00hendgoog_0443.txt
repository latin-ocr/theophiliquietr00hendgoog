lanu is formed in the earth, in form of stonee, which (iron)
is dug up in the earne manner as the copper, above mentioned,
and itis broken, and is mixed together in lumps, it is then
melted in the iron worker’s fornace, and it ie hammered that
it may become lit sor any kind ol work. lt is called Calibe,
from the mount Calybe, iu which the most is known of ite
practice3 wherelore it ie prepared in the same manner that it
may become lit for work. When, therefore, you shall have
prepared the iron, and have made bite from it, or other eques·
trian utensile, aud wish to decorate them with gold or silver,
take the purest silver, and thin it much by hammering.
Then you have a wooden wheel, of oek, a loot in dia·
meter and turned, which must be uarrow at the outer part,
and everywhere thick in the middle, where another circulor
wood ie lixed on to it, in which it can be revolved, to which
also, at one end, another circular wood may be placed, with
which it can be turned round. And when you have adapted
this wheel between two small columne, make about its outer
edge small cuttings like steps, which incline buckwarde; these
columns, in which the wheel is displayed, must be firmly
fixed upon a bench lengthwise, eo that the round wood may
beon the right hand. There may aleo stand yet another

. column at the lelt haud, in frent, near the wheel, in which a

thiu wood muet be fixed, so that it may lie upon the wheel
and have at ite extremity a small piece ol eteel, ol the length
and breadth of the smallest finger nail, firmly fixed through
an opening, and extremely sbarp, so that when the wheel ie
revolved, this wood may always fall from one step to another,
that being so vibrated, the steel may cut into whatsoever ie
applied. When you have liled a spur smoothly, place it over
the glowing coele until it hes become black, end hold it,
having become cold, in the left hand, and revolve the wheel
with the right, and applying it to the steel‚ cut finely over tbe
