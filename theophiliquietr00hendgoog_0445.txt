whole outside lengthwise, and again douhly in its breadth.
This being done, with the small pincers rub and overlay small
picces of silver as you may desire, and with the same forceps
rnb the tops of the silver particles, that they may adhere.

And when you have worked the whole, place it anew over
the glowing coals until it is again made black, and raising it
with the pincers, you carefully polish it with the long piece of
steel, fixed in a handle and very smooth, and being placed
over the coals, you again warm it and again polish it strongly
with the same instrument. But should you wish to gild it in
parts, or wholly, it is in your power. ln this manner bits
and other equestrian utensile, or whatsoever you will in iron,
you cut in the above manner, but more deeply, you can also
have very fine wires of silver and of gold, with them you can
form for yourself very small flowers and circles, or any other
thing which it may please you, and place it with the slender
forceps upon the iron as yon may wish, and with the short
hammer strike gently, that it may adhere, and let there be
always one small flower golden, the other silver. All the
space, however, of the whole iron being filled up, lay it over
the ceals until it g'row blaok, and beat it carelirlly with the
middling sized hammer, until wherever the iron appear these
incisione may become smooth, and thus the work may appear
as if blackened. Should you wish to have letters upon blades
or other instrumente, sculp them first with the hollowing iron,
then a thick silver wire being made, form the letters with the
slender forceps and lay them in these hollows, and beating
above them with the hammer fill them. You can also in this
manner make flowers aud circles upon the iron, and fill them
with wires of copper and brass. Should, however, anything
of this work become broken through age or carelessness, if
you wish to acquire the silver in it, place it in the lire until it
glowS, and holding it in the left hand with the forceps, with
the right rub a long piece of lead over all places where the
silver appears, and immediately it liquefias with the melted
lead and is mixed with itÍ¾ and the lead is thus burned, and
the silver procured.
