01² somniante IRON.

Tum rings are also made from irou, which are placed upon
the handles of iron instrumente, which cannot be made
firm by themselves, a thiu pisce of copper is folded round
these at the join, and a little clay is placed around it. This
being dry, when, being blown upon, it has become glowing
under the coals before the furnace, tha melted copper in-
stantly flows around and solders it. ln this manner also
tinned keys, and any other things in iron can be soldered.
But should you wish to make loclrs with which clothes chests
are fastened, beat a thin piace os iron, aud bend it round
another round iron, and join a bottom to it above and below.

ing it around sprinkle this powder about it. Which being
dry, you again overlay this mixture mora tbicldy, and placing
it upon the embers and carefully eovering it about, as the
silver above, you will solder it in the same manner, and,
having cooled by itself, you will wash it. Yon can solder
whatever you wish, iu iron, in this manner, which can,

over, in iron, file it first, and before you may touch it with
the hand, tbrow it newly tiled into a pot of melted tin with
grease, and stir it with the tongs until it becomes white, and
being taken out, shake it strongly, and clean it with bran and
aliuen eloth. When you havemadeiron looks and bindings ol
caslrets and doors, you warm them lastly and anoint them with
