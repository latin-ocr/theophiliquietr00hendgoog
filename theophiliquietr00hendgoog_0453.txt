CHAPTER XCIV.

ΟΡ constituo GEMS.

Carsran, which is water hardened into ice, and the ice of great
age is hardened into stone, is trimmed and polished in this
manner. Take the composition which is called tenax, of
² which mention is made above, and applying it to the fire
‘⁵ until it liquefy, yon will fasten the crystal to along wood,
which must be similar to it in thickness. When this has be·
¹ come cold, you will rub it with both hands upon a hard sand-

· stone, water being added, until it takes the form which you
¹³ wish to give it, then upon another stone of the seme kind,

which must be finer and smoother, until it be made quite
