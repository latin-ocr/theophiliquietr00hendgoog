may be able to lie half in it, and yon will fasten it with wax
in this same piace ol wood that it may adhere; arrd taking a
small hammer atrike lightly in tbe middle of the knob in one
place until you make a small hole, and so by striking in'the
contre and by carefully breaking around lt you will increase
the hollow. And when by thus persevering you have arrived
at the very middle of the knob, turn it round and do similarly
upon the other side. When you have transpiereed this, beat
apiece of copper the length of a foot, and round, so that it
can pass through the opening, and taking ehorp saud mixed
with water, place it in the opening and lile with the copper.
When you have somewhat dilated the opening, beat another
thicker copper, with which you will file in a similar manner,
and should need be you add a third thicker copper. And
when you have enlarged the opening as you may wish, break
asand·stone very finely, and this being placed in, you will

· file it with a new copper until it become even. Then take a

piece of lead, rouuded in the same manner, and the powder
of tile, with saliva being added, you polish the opening inside,
aud the knob itsell outside, as above. Pares crystal ol a
very round form, and polished and moistened with water or
saliva, and exposed in the light of the sun, tinder which they
call “ tentura” being placed under it, so that the light may Ι
shine upon it, attracta fire with the greatest velocity. But
should you wish to cut crystal, fix four wooden pegs upon a
bench, between which the crystal ean lie llrmly, which pega
will so stand, that two must be joined together above and¹
two below, so closely that the saw can scarcely be drawn be-
tween thern, and that it cau in no part be turned, and placing
on the iron saw, and casting over it sharp sand mixed with..
water, make two (assistants) stand who can draw it, and who
must cast the saud with water upon it without intermission.
This must be done until the crystal be divided into two pisces,
which you will rub and polish over as above. ln the same

manner the onyx and beryl, malachite‚ jasper and agate and
other precious stones are cut, rubbed and polisbed3 a very
fine powder is also made of fragments of crystal which, mixed*
with water, is placed upon a flat piece of lime-wood, and these
