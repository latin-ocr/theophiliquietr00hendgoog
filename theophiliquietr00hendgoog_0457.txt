these are perforated with a fine steeled instrument whichis
fixed in wood, having a small wheel of lead, also another
wood in which it may be turned, to which a strap must be
placed by which it may be revolved. But should it be neces·
sary that the apertura of any pearl be made larger, awire
may be placed in the opening with a little fine send, one eud
ol which may be held in the teeth, the other in the left hand,
and by the right the pearl is conducted upwards aud down-
wards, aud in the mean time send is applied, that the aperture
may become wider. Sea shells are also cut into pieces and
are liled aa pearls, sufficiently useful upon gold, aud they are
poliched as above.
