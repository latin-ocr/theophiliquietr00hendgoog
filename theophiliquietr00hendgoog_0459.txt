Snounn any one wish to feshion beautiful writing in gold, let
him read what l say in lowly verse. Let him grind gold

with pure wine until it hos become well dissolved3 l advise
thet he should osten wash it, for the white page of the book
demands this. Let him afterwards melre this liquid, with the
gluten of bull’s skin, or, if he wish, with the gluten of gum.
And when hc hes taken the gold with e stick or pen, let him
stir it, should he seek to write beautifully. But ester this,
when the writing has become dry, let him make it very
shining with the tooth of a wild bear.
