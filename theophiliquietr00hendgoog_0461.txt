CHAPTER XCVIII.

01² ’I‘HE ΠΥ ΔΝΙ) OF LAKE.

Ar your request, dearest brother, that 1 should discouree to
you of the ivy, which the poete and artists much loved‚ on
account of the secret powers which they recognised it con-
tained within itself:-for the songs of poete, when they had
been recited in the theatre before an assembly of the Romans,
were accustomed to be crowned with ivy :-the ancient artiets
aleo invented many colours from this, one of which, in
writing,l can show yon. In the mouth of March, when plante
end trees take up their sap from mother earth, take an auger
and perforate the small boughs of the ivy in places, anda
gummy liquid will flow out from them, from which a blood
colour is made, by seething, which ie called lake. Seeth
therefore the gum liquor, which I have before mentioned to
you, in nnnc, ,and yon will have the blood colour, which is
useful in writings and paintinge. From this also tbe “par-
cia''¹ ie made, which omamente rame end goats' skins with
arose colour.

01³ A GREEN COLOUR.

Snounn one wish to melre agreen colour fit for writing let him
take the green leaves of the plant which is commonly called
nightehade, end cerelirlly grind it upon a marble stone with
white chelk until they be quite liquid, and best suited for the
purpose of writing. This being done, dip a pen, or anoint a
pencil in thie colour, and illuminate capital letters which you
wish to ornament with the same colour. But beware,
brother, that you do not put too much chalk with the juice of
the learee‘.
