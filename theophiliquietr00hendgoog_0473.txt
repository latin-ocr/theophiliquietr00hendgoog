Seouuu you wirb to gild oopper with the unctuoue substance
ol gell, first ecrepe it with e knife, and then with a beer'v
tooth quickly polish it 3 and thie being done, paint the gell
with epencil over it, end when it hee become dry, point it
ageio end egein, end take cere thet you do not drew the
pencil more in one place then another, but thet it be equally
covered with the liquor ol gall. Let not what I tell you ap·
peer false, who heve proved thie ert to be true, end heve in·
vented it, the God, whose fountein is os wiedom, assutiugss

on une reunnnnvo or ree erunonon’s emoneo.

Some the eturgeon'e bledder in water until, by bruising it
between the hands, you cen make it like e cerate, end then
place itin very clear water in e pot, end put it to the lire, eo
thet it may not boil, but may receive euch beet that, being .
liquefled, it mey be converted into water. Then otreio it
into e beein through e eleen eloth, end leave it in e oold
place thet it may heve eceees to the eir, that it moy coagulete.
When, leying on the linger, yon heve preesed it, should the
gluten reeiet, end not be broken by thet pressure, rnelt it et
the lire end pour it upon the gold, end work it very hot, with
tow. But should the gluten grow too thick, admit e little
water end work. Should it, however, be too soli, eo thet it
cannot retein the impression of the finger, cook it better ¹et
the lire, end you oen easily eollen thie gluten at the lire end
melre it firm. You never edd gum to gold or other metele:
for whatever, it being hard, shall be gummed with it, quickly
falls off, colours being excepted, which eleo will not stand well,
unless they ere very well ground together end ere very thinly
pointed on the books.
