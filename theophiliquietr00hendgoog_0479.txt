glass vase, and again pour wine over the sediment, and place
it again in the above mentioned place, and they do this the

whole year, adding a portion of green. Those, however,
who wish to procure it sooner, grind this green with wine
as directed above, and then it is used for writing as vmmilion,
or saure, it is ground with wine3 you then take the best wine
and put it into any brass or copper vessel, and you boil it.
This being cooked and cleansed from froth, keep it and
temper the green colour with it and place it in the warmth of
the sun, or a slow fire, until it hes become moderately thick,
and putting yellow and the powder of calcined bones into it,

with the old, it will possess another green colour; should it

with the green, and with this liquor grind the green upon a -

stone, and temper with it, and it will thus he good.
