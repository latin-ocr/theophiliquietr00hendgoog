main. Therefore, as often as you wish to make your red
brisil, which is accustomed to become discolourad and to
thieken, put in some alum, and so it will be improved and,
when become thick with the gleire, will often be reuewed.
lf you mix white with brisil it vvill make a rose oolour. If
you mix blue, it will make purple.

01² SINOPER.

You grind sinoper in the same manner as vermilion. You
can mix a little white with that, and it will be a rosy colour.
Also if you mix a little sinoper with white it will ba a car-

the orpiment being overcome, it will be a red colour.

a little eooled, put some good alum into it, temper it as you
wish it well seasoned, afterwards warm it a little, stining
all the things. Being cold, put gleire of egg in it and
leave it until, aster two or three days, it has become ma·
tured. But should it be too clear, place it where it can be-

come thick, not in the sun, however, and so it will be im-
proved. Also put the shred of brisil, very fine, into strong
gleire, and after two or three (days) it will become matured.
You can likewise temper woad a second or third time, but
beware that it do not become quite dvy. Grind blue earth
upon a stone with water, stirring it with the linger and apply·

it through a delicate eloth, that it may be cleaner. This being
purified and dried, put to it some strong glaire; afterwards
talre yolk of fresh egg and mix it with water and wine in equal
parts,'and put very little into the colour, and it will make it
