Orpiment is ground with great labour, and is therefore to
be ground in a mortar like pepper, or, should you not heve
this, rolled in a skin, then upon the marble with water, estha
other colours. ln the tempering of this, take two parts of it,
and a third (pert) of yolk of fresh egg, and more of the
powder of calcined bones, mixed together; all colours are
ground with water, which being withdrawn and carefully
taken out, glaire is put into them, except in Greek green.

Ochre is ground with water, but it is not necessary un·
less to painters upon walls and in gold work ol letters.

Saffron can be tempered with gleire of egg, or with wine,
and a red colour is mede, so thet it can be mixed with brisil.

The bright and thick colours for parchment are these, Ver-
milion, Orpiment, Greek green, Dragon’s blood, Gravetum,
lndigo, Carmine, Saffron, Folium, Brunum, Minium, White,
Black, the best from vine charcoal, (tempered) with egg, as
the other colours.
