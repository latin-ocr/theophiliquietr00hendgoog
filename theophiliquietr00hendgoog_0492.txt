whether they were not accuatomed to separate gold from ailver, or
other alloy, through the action of there acide, which, attacking the
foreign matters contained by the ore, lell the gold pure.

The procera, described hy Theophraatua, which waa employed
in order to procure quickailver from native cinnabar byrubbing
the ore in a hraar mortar, with a brata peatle, with ὅξος, haa
been remarked, p. ⁵6. Theophrastus adda, “And marry other
things os thia kind other perrona, perhapr, may attain.''¹

Pliny ia more explicit, or rather the acience had advanced since
the Greek had written, and the prediction ol Theophrastus had
apparently been lulfilled.

ln the chapter upon gold, L. 38. C. 4, Pliny hande down thia
remarkable sentence.

'⁸ Terretur etiarn curn ralia grume, pondere triplici mitto, et rur-
aum cum duabus salia portionibus, et una lapidis, quem achiaton
vocant: ita virne tradit rebua und crematis in fictili vaae, ipsum
purum et incorruptum.’'

“lt ia aleo calcined with aalt grumus, mixed in threelold weight,

arrd again with two portione of aalt end one of a etone which they
call achiatue: thur, the substancea being burned together in an
earthen maeel, the bitterness yielde it pure and uncorrupted.”
ι Should the ‘⁸ aal grumua”' be the aulphate ol potaah, (Gloubcr’r

ol roda.) with the presence os water, yielded by the aalta ancl alu·
mine, would, under the action os heat, yield amuriatic or hydro·
chlorio aeid, called in aller timer “the apirit os aalt,” the gold would
be liberated‚ the aulphur combining with the aode, alumine, dre.

The schiston waa of many kinds, one a sort ol' hematite, another
os anthracite, but a third a apeciea ol calcanthua, or sulphureus
copper ore, from which a schiston war made, called by Pliny a
concrete alum-thia ir no other than our chrystalliaed aulphate
os copper ⁸.
