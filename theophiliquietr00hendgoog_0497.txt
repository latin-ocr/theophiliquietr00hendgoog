The process here described is calculated 1ο produce the same
action upon the surface ο1 cn impure gold as that followed by
submitting it 1ο the action ο1 1 diluted muriatic acid. Atrameutum,
or the sulphate of copper, (oricum) having been partly deprived
of the sulphuric acid 11 contains, ia again subjected to heat in the
presence ο1 muriate ο1 soda and the uric salts, upon the surlace ο1
the gold to be purified. The result would form a certain propor-
tiou ο1 muriatic acid which, removing the alloy 11 might contain,
would render the gold pure, thereby colouring, or rather de-co·
louring the metal.
