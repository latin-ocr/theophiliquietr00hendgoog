The differente between “aas ” and ‘⁸ aurichalcum,'' both a brass,
is taught us by Theophilus 3 “aa'' is the mixture oi calamiae with
unrefined copper-“ aurichalcum ” is made with very pure copper,
because it can then be gilt. C. 66.

Bell rnetal is made by adding a filth of tin to melted copper. G.
6³.
Theophilus speaks of Spanish brusa, as used in thin plates iu
stamped work. This, being gilt, is probably a thiu plate ol' topper
coated with gold by the process described iu note to C. 48, p.
4³2.

C. Lxxtl. INTERRASlLlS OPUS.

Critics have differcd as to the interpretation oi this word.
“Quod nunc scripturis nune planitie variatur ς hoc, et nou aliud.
opus, interrasile dicas.”—Alex. By this would be intended an

engrsved work, varied with plain auriaces. lt has been called
“Anaglypha Scriptura,'' carved work. Muratori thought that it
applied only to the species of engraving iu the manner of scala.
“Quo nomine opinor, non omnem caelaturam designari, sed earu
tantum, quae incidendo figuras efformabat, ut est in sigillia.” (V.
2, p. 360.) Theophilus, in designating this as Arabian work, has
caused Emeric David¹ and M. de l'Escalopier² to think that the
word interrasilis means Damascus work, ‘¹ damasquiasre,” or the
threaded gold or silver work scen upon the sabres, pistols, cui-
rssses, dra, oi the east. We fortunately possess a chapter in this
MS. in which this latter art is careiully detailed3 the damascius
work is described in one oi tlre chapters hitherto unknown, C. ⁹0.

The opus interrasilis, then, is sn engraved or sculptured plate,
the plain grounds oi which are cut out with the chisel, or “maisel,”
in the German. Our ancient English hrasses are of this nature.

C. LXXV. OF STAMPED work.
