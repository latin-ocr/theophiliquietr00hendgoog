C· LXXXI. “DE ORGANlS.”

lt will be seen that the Harleian MS. ol Theophilus enriches
the archaeologist with three new chapters upon the construction of
the orgen, which seems in the time of our author to have been os a
simple construction.

David, in the cl. Psalm, speaks os the orgen, which does not
appear to have become known to Western Europe until the year
757, when one was sent as a present to Pepin·le·Brsf, by the Em-
peror Constantine copronymus.

ln a rare Saxon manuscript of the eleventh century,-·Oottou,
Tiberius, B. 6, pege 18, is a drawing of the “ aunauauu curn lis·
tula oerea,” with brass pipe; also another description of “bross
bumbula, with the pipes placed in the middle, three bumbula
placed on every side.” This Bunauauu appears to be an orgen,
which is souuded by withdrawing the stops, being, as the organa
of Theophilus, unfurnished with keys. The pipes are of very
thin and pure copper.

ln a notice of the “Church of the Holy Cross,” at Binstead, lsle ,
of Wight, by Mr. Withers—(Weale's Quarterly Paperson Archi-
tecture, Midsummer, 1845) which church is of early Norman erec·
tion, a recess in the wallon the north side of the chancel remains

unexplained, as that gentlemen states that no traces exist on the
outside wall to show that a sacristy has ever existed there. Simi-
lar necesses are found in our early Normen churches elsewhere,
one in the church at Beaulieu, Hampshire, il I am not mistaken. ·

A probable solution of the use to which these recesses were ap-
plied is found in the 83 0. ‘⁶ Si volueris organa ultra maceriam
muri stabilire, itaut infre monasterium nihil appareet‚'’ dac. They
were sor the purpose of a proper arrangement of the organ and the
seat ol the organist‚ at that time the chanter also.
