calcination (in acloee veeeel fitted with an upper chamber) of
brasc or oi' calamine, appears to heve been the white sulphur ol
the Byzantinos and Arabe. Both these substancee generally con-
tained arsenio, the volatilizetion of which, with that of the zinc,
would produce a mixture of the oxidee of arsenio end zinc3 the
deposition in the lower chamber‚ of e derker colour eud lese pure,
were combinatione of the rinc with other eubeteucee‚ accord-
ing to the nature of the ore calamiae employed, eod wne called
epodium1.

Albertus Magnus, whose writinge are in great mensure a re- ,
eume of the Greek and Arnb chemiste, telle ue that breee will

The lnior λιῢκω, white sulphur, was thet which produced white
brasc: Olympiodorue knew that arsenio geue a white colour to
copper, end he celle it o kind os sulphur which ir volatilined hythe

Richardue Anglicue, who appears to here been contemporaneoue
with Roger Becon, telle ue that “white sulphur lixee (coagulat)

white sulphur.'’⁴

An impure mixture oi oxide ol arsenic with rinc or tin, would,
mixed with white gloss, yield en opeque flux, proper for pointing
